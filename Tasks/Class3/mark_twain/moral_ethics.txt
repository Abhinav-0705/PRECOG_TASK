Here is the first batch (1–10) of paragraphs on the topic of "Morals and Ethics," observed with the skeptical eye
of a sinner who is trying his best.

Batch 1: The Burden of Conscience 1. The Physicality of the Conscience A conscience is a creature that occupies more
space in the human interior than the liver or the lights. It is a dormant beast for the most part,
sleeping soundly while a boy is engaged in the pleasure of throwing rocks at a barn. But let the sun
go down, and the beast wakes up. It does not speak in a reasonable tone; it nags. It reminds the
owner of the lie told at breakfast, the apple taken from the pantry, and the cat whose tail was pulled.
It transforms a soft feather bed into a pile of rocks. A boy reckons that if he could only have
his conscience removed, like a wart, he could be a happy and successful pirate, but as it stands, he is
a prisoner to a voice that only speaks up when it is too late to fix anything.

2. The Economy of the Truth We are taught that the Truth is a precious thing, more valuable than gold or
rubies. This is why, I suppose, most people use it so sparingly. To tell the whole truth, all the time,
is to invite disaster. If a boy tells his aunt that her bonnet looks like a bird's nest, he is
punished for insolence. If he tells her it is beautiful, he is praised for his manners. He quickly learns that
"morality" in polite society is often just the art of lying with a straight face. He decides that the Truth
is indeed precious, and therefore should be saved for extreme emergencies, like a court of law or a deathbed confession.

3. The Ambiguity of the Watermelon The taking of a watermelon from a neighbor’s patch is a matter of semantic debate.
To the owner, it is stealing. To the boy, it is merely "hooking." Stealing is a low crime committed by
burglars who take money. Hooking is a high adventure committed by hungry explorers. The moral quality of the act depends
entirely on the ripeness of the melon. If the melon is green and sour, the boy feels a pang of
guilt, believing that Providence is punishing him for his greed. If the melon is sweet and red, he feels that
the Lord has blessed his enterprise. Thus, the flavor of the fruit determines the state of the soul.

4. The Sunday School Transaction The moral education of the young is conducted on a cash basis. A boy does not
memorize the Beatitudes because he wishes to be pure in heart; he memorizes them to earn a blue ticket. Ten
blue tickets buy a red one; ten red ones buy a Bible. The Bible is worth forty cents. The boy
works for weeks, straining his memory, not for the spiritual nourishment, but for the glory of the prize. He is
a mercenary soldier in the army of the Lord. When he finally wins the Bible, he is often disappointed to
find it contains no pictures of giants or battles, and he wonders if he wouldn't have been better off trading
his tickets for a bag of marbles and a clear conscience.

5. The Danger of the Model Boy Every town is afflicted with a "Model Boy." He is the one who loves
Sunday School, washes his neck without being told, and says "Yes, sir" to the parson. He is held up by
all the mothers as a standard of perfection. The other boys hate him with a pure, white-hot passion. They view
his morality as a personal insult. They wait for him to fall—to drop a book, to tear his trousers, to
say a bad word. When he finally slips, the joy in the community of sinners is unconfined. It proves the
great moral theorem of childhood: that nobody can be that good without being secretly rotten on the inside.

6. The Prayer of the Emergency A boy’s relationship with the Almighty is strictly one of crisis management. He does not
pray when the sun is shining and the fish are biting. But let a thunderstorm break over the river while
he is out in a stolen skiff, and he becomes a saint immediately. He promises to lead a better life;
he promises to be kind to the cat; he promises to stop smoking grapevine. He offers these virtues as a
bribe to the elements. The moment the storm passes and his feet touch dry land, the contract is void. He
reckons that God knows he was just talking to hear himself, and that a promise made under duress doesn't count
in a court of law.

7. The Hypocrisy of the Funeral When a man dies who was known to be mean, stingy, and generally unpleasant, a
strange transformation occurs at his funeral. The minister stands over the box and describes a saint. He speaks of the
deceased’s generosity (which was non-existent) and his sweet temper (which was a myth). The congregation sits in respectful silence, nodding
their heads. The boy, sitting in the back, is confused. He wonders if they have buried the wrong man. He
learns that it is a social crime to speak the truth about the dead, and that the only time a
man is guaranteed a good reputation is when he is no longer around to disprove it.

8. The Virtue of Laziness Society praises the industrious ant and scorns the grasshopper. But a boy observes that it is
the industrious people who cause all the trouble. The bankers, the lawyers, and the politicians are always busy, and they
are always miserable. The town drunkard, on the other hand, sleeps in the sun, fishes all day, and never hurts
a fly. He is perfectly happy. The boy begins to suspect that "laziness" is just a slanderous term for "contentment."
He wonders if the moral thing to do is to sit still and let the world turn, rather than running
around trying to fix things that aren't broken.

9. The Problem of "Doing Good" A boy is often seized by a sudden impulse to "do good." He decides to
help an old lady across the street. He grabs her arm and propels her forward. She screams; she drops her
basket; she hits him with her umbrella. It turns out she didn't want to cross the street. The boy stands
there, bruised and baffled. He learns that benevolence is a dangerous trade. He realizes that most people do not want
to be helped; they want to be left alone. He decides that in the future, he will keep his charity
to himself, as it is safer for the public peace.

10. The Elasticity of Principles A man will stand on a soapbox and declare that he would never, under any circumstances,
touch a drop of whiskey. He calls it the Devil’s broth. He is a man of principle. Then, he gets
a toothache. Suddenly, a little whiskey is necessary for "medicinal purposes." He takes a swallow, then another to be sure
the cure takes hold. His principle has not broken; it has merely stretched. A boy watches this and learns that
a principle is like a suspender: it is designed to hold things up, but it must have enough give to
allow for a full stomach or a sudden change in the weather.

11. The Hierarchy of Theft To the mind of a boy, the definition of theft is fluid and depends entirely on
the value of the object and the state of the stomach. To take a penny from a collection plate is
a sin of the blackest dye, liable to cause immediate lightning strikes. To take a donut from a cooling rack
is a crime, but a pardonable one, driven by necessity. To take a green apple from a tree that hangs
over a public fence is not stealing at all; it is merely harvesting a natural resource that would otherwise go
to waste. A boy creates a moral ladder where the theft of money is at the top, the theft of
food is in the middle, and the theft of a kiss is a heroic deed that should be rewarded with
a medal.

12. The Burden of a Good Reputation There is no heavier load for a boy to carry than a good reputation.
If he is known as a "truth-teller," he is trapped. He cannot make an excuse for being late without the
entire town gasping in horror. He cannot hold a fishing pole on a Sunday without shaking the foundations of the
church. He is watched by every grandmother and deacon in the county. He looks with envy at the town pariah,
the boy who is known to smoke and swear. That boy is free. If he does something good, like rescuing
a kitten, he is hailed as a reformed soul; if he does something bad, nobody is surprised. A bad reputation
is a suit of armor; a good one is a glass house.

13. The Ethics of "Finders Keepers" The law of the playground is simple: possession is nine-tenths of the law, and discovery
is the other tenth. If a boy finds a knife in the road, he does not ask who lost it;
he thanks Providence for the gift. To return it would be to interfere with the mysterious workings of Fate. He
reasons that the loser was careless and therefore unworthy of such a fine instrument, while he, being observant, is the
rightful heir. This logic holds up perfectly until he loses his own marbles, at which point he becomes a staunch
advocate for the restoration of property and the strict enforcement of the police statutes.

14. The Charity of the Unwanted True charity, we are told, is giving away what is precious. But human nature prefers
to give away what is broken. When a collection is taken up for the heathen or the poor, a boy
searches his room. He does not give his favorite top or his sharpest shooter. He gives the tin soldier with
no head; he gives the kite with the broken frame. He feels a warm glow of benevolence as he dumps
this refuse into the basket. He imagines the poor will be delighted with his trash. He learns early that "philanthropy"
is often just a fancy word for cleaning out the attic and feeling holy about it.

15. The Selective Hearing of the Conscience A conscience is a peculiar instrument that works best when the audience is large.
If a boy is tempted to trip his sister in the parlor, right in front of the preacher, his conscience
shouts, "Forbear!" But if he is alone in the woods, and he sees a bird’s nest that is just out
of reach, his conscience goes remarkably silent. It seems to take a nap during the commission of the crime and
only wakes up afterwards to complain about the result. It is a retrospective moralist, useless for prevention but excellent for
ruining a good night's sleep with "I told you so," even though it never said a word at the time.

16. The Sin of Profanity A swear word is a safety valve for the soul. When a man hits his thumb
with a hammer, a "Great Caesar's Ghost!" simply does not do the work. It requires something stronger, something with fire
and brimstone in it, to relieve the pressure. A boy knows that these words are forbidden, which gives them their
power. He keeps them in his pocket like firecrackers, waiting for the right moment. When he finally lets one fly—perhaps
at a stubborn mule—he feels a thrill of liberation. He realizes that while silence may be golden, a well-placed expletive
is the only thing that can truly express the tragedy of a stubbed toe.

17. The Lie of the "Thank You" Politeness is the civilized form of hypocrisy. A boy is taught that when he
receives a gift, he must say "Thank you" with a smile, even if the gift is a pair of wool
socks when he wanted a pistol. He must write a letter expressing his delight. He must lie to his grandmother,
to his aunts, and to the world. He is trained to be a fraud. If he were to speak the
moral truth—"I hate these socks and I wish you had sent candy"—he would be whipped for ingratitude. Thus, he learns
that society values a pleasant liar far more than an honest ingrate.

18. The Sanctity of the Promise A promise made by a boy to another boy—"Cross my heart and hope to die"—is
a binding contract written in blood and honor. To break it is to become a pariah. But a promise made
to an adult—"I will weed the garden"—is a loose arrangement subject to the weather, the mood, and the biting of
the fish. The boy reasons that adults extract these promises through force and intimidation, and therefore they are not legally
binding. He keeps his word to his equals because he needs their respect; he breaks his word to his superiors
because he knows they will likely forget it by Tuesday anyway.

19. The Morality of the Fishing Hole If a boy discovers a prime fishing hole where the catfish bite as fast
as you can drop a line, he faces a moral crisis. The Christian thing to do is to share this
good news with his friends. The sensible thing to do is to keep his mouth shut and cover his tracks.
He usually chooses the latter. He lies about where he has been. He tells his friends the fish were caught
in a muddy creek miles away. He guards his secret with the jealousy of a miser. He realizes that while
the Lord loves a cheerful giver, He likely also respects a man who knows how to keep a good thing
to himself.

20. The Guilt of the Uncaught There is a specific kind of agony reserved for the crime that goes undetected. If
a boy breaks a window and runs away, and no one ever finds out, he expects to feel relief. Instead,
he feels a haunting dread. Every time his father clears his throat, the boy jumps. Every time the Sheriff walks
by, the boy sweats. He carries the secret like a lead weight. He almost wishes they would catch him and
thrash him, just to end the suspense. He learns that the fear of punishment is often far worse than the
punishment itself, and that a clear conscience is the only pillow that doesn't have rocks in it.

21. The Vanity of Self-Denial There is a certain type of person who gives up tobacco, or swearing, or pie, not
for the sake of health, but for the sake of bragging. They walk around with a halo of self-righteousness that
is blinding to the naked eye. A boy who decides to stop eating candy for a week does not do
it in secret; he announces it to the schoolyard. He wants the glory of martyrdom without the inconvenience of dying.
He watches others eat with a look of holy pity. He learns that the greatest pleasure in having a virtue
is not the virtue itself, but the opportunity to make everyone else feel like a sinner for enjoying themselves.

22. The Paradox of the stray Dog A boy who will tie a tin can to a dog's tail on Tuesday
will fight a bloody battle to protect that same dog on Wednesday. This moral inconsistency is baffling to the logician
but perfectly natural to the human heart. On Tuesday, the dog was an object of amusement, a prop in a
comedy. On Wednesday, a stranger kicked the dog, and suddenly the dog became "Mine." The boy defends the animal not
out of abstract kindness, but out of territorial pride. He learns that our compassion is often just a form of
ownership—we protect what belongs to us, and the rest of the world can fend for itself.

23. The Ethics of the "White Lie" We are told that a lie is a abomination. Yet, if a boy tells
his grandmother that her cookies are hard as rocks, he is whipped. He is forced to say they are "delicious."
He realizes that society runs on the "White Lie"—the grease that keeps the gears of civilization from grinding together. He
observes that adults lie constantly: they say they are "delighted" to see guests they detest; they say the baby is
"beautiful" when it looks like a boiled shrimp. He concludes that truth is a dangerous weapon that should be sheathed
in velvet, or better yet, left at home when visiting relatives.

24. The Justification of Revenge The Bible says to turn the other cheek. The playground says to hit back, and aim
for the nose. A boy tries to reconcile these two codes. He reasons that if he turns the other cheek,
he will simply get hit twice, which seems like a waste of a good face. He decides that the Bible
was likely written for people who didn't have to deal with the school bully. He adopts a modified theology: turn
the other cheek once to show you are a Christian, then strike back with a rock to show you are
a man. It is a practical compromise between salvation and survival.

25. The Moral Weight of Sunday Clothes It is impossible to be wicked in a starch-stiffened collar and a new suit.
The clothes themselves enforce a rigid morality. A boy cannot climb a tree, or wrestle in the dirt, or steal
a melon while wearing his Sunday best. He walks stiffly, afraid to bend his knees. He feels superior to the
ragged boys on the corner, but also deeply envious of their freedom. He realizes that "goodness" is often just a
lack of opportunity to be bad, imposed by the fear of ruining expensive fabric. He longs for his old trousers,
in which a man can sin comfortably.

26. The Fallacy of the Ant and the Grasshopper The fable teaches that the Ant who works all summer is wise,
and the Grasshopper who plays is a fool. A boy watches the ants. They run around frantically, carrying burdens ten
times their weight, never stopping to enjoy the sun. They look miserable. The grasshopper, meanwhile, fiddles and hops and has
a grand time. The boy wonders if the moral is really about preparation, or if it is just a trick
to get children to do their chores. He suspects that the Ant dies of exhaustion and the Grasshopper dies of
fun, and given the choice, he knows which exit he prefers.

27. The Suspicion of the "Reform" When the town drunkard stands up in the revival meeting and pledges to never touch
a drop again, the town weeps with joy. The boy, however, is skeptical. He has seen this show before. He
knows that the "reform" usually lasts exactly as long as the emotional high of the meeting. He learns that repentance
is easy; it is the staying repented that is the hard work. He watches the "saved" man with the eye
of a scientist waiting for a volcano to erupt, knowing that human nature is a stubborn thing that rarely changes
its shape permanently just because of a hymn and a handshake.

28. The Ethics of Eavesdropping To listen at a keyhole is considered low and dishonorable. But if a boy happens to
be sitting under the parlor window when a secret is being discussed, is he morally obligated to plug his ears?
He reasons that he is merely a passive recipient of sound waves. If the adults choose to broadcast their business
into the atmosphere, it is public property. He listens with a clear conscience, gathering intelligence on the mysteries of the
adult world. He decides that knowledge is power, and how one gets it is a detail best left to the
philosophers.

29. The Confusion of "Duty" Duty is a word adults use when they want you to do something unpleasant. It is
a boy's duty to weed the garden; it is his duty to be polite to the aunt with the mustache.
He never hears of a duty to go fishing or eat cake. He begins to associate the word with misery.
He wonders why Duty and Pleasure are always at war. He suspects that if something is enjoyable, it is probably
a sin, and if it is painful, it is undoubtedly a virtue. This grim calculus makes him wary of anyone
who claims to be doing something for his "own good."

30. The Injustice of the "Example" When a boy is caught throwing a spitball, he is punished not just for the
act, but to "set an example" for the class. He is thrashed publicly. He feels the unfairness of this deeply.
He is being used as a scarecrow. He is suffering for the potential future crimes of others. He reasons that
he should only be punished for the spitball itself—a small crime worth perhaps two whacks—not for the moral improvement of
thirty other boys. He learns that justice is rarely about the individual; it is about crowd control, and he is
merely the unlucky prop in the performance.

31. The Missionary Box Dilemma On the mantelpiece sits a small wooden box destined for the "heathen in the dark lands."
A boy is encouraged to drop his penny into this slot rather than into the hand of the candy merchant.
It is a severe test of character. The heathen is an abstract concept, a shadowy figure thousands of miles away
who may or may not appreciate the sacrifice. The stick of licorice, however, is a tangible reality, black and sweet
and present. The boy reasons that the heathen can surely wait another week for salvation, whereas his own appetite is
a pressing matter of the here and now. He drops a button into the box to make the clinking sound,
satisfying the public requirement of charity while keeping his capital for the candy counter.

32. The Logic of Unanswered Prayer A boy prays with great fervor for a blizzard to close the schoolhouse, or for
a fishing pole to appear on his bed. When the sun shines and the bed is empty, he faces a
theological crisis. He does not lose faith; rather, he adjusts his estimation of the Almighty’s business practices. He reckons that
Providence is too busy counting the hairs on people’s heads to worry about the geography of a school day. He
decides that prayer is a gamble, like fishing in a muddy creek—you might catch something, but you mostly just sit
there and wait. He resolves to rely on his own devices next time, perhaps by eating a green persimmon to
induce a providential sickness.

33. The Envy of the Cat The family cat is a creature of pure instinct, unburdened by the heavy furniture of
morality. If the cat catches a bird, it does not weep; it eats. If it sleeps on the best chair,
it feels no guilt. The boy watches this animal with deep envy. He sees that the cat is happy because
it has no conscience to nag it. It does not worry about hell or the opinion of the neighbors. The
boy wonders if "morality" is simply a human invention designed to make us miserable, a set of invisible chains that
prevents us from enjoying life with the carefree savagery of a feline.

34. The Flavor of Stolen Fruit There is a widely held belief among the youth that a stolen watermelon tastes sweeter
than one paid for. This is not a culinary fact, but a moral one. The bought melon tastes of commerce
and permission; it is flat and safe. The stolen melon tastes of danger, of the moonlight, of the barking dog
and the breathless escape. It is seasoned with the spice of sin. The boy eats it with a gusto that
the honest man can never know. He suspects that if Eve had simply bought the apple, the history of the
human race would have been much duller, though perhaps less painful.

35. The Peril of Good Intentions A boy decides to be helpful and weed the garden without being asked. In his
zeal, he pulls up the prize tulips, mistaking them for enemies of the state. When his mother sees the carnage,
she does not praise his industry; she laments her flowers. The boy is punished for his helpfulness. He learns a
bitter lesson: that good intentions are no defense against incompetence. He decides that the safest course of action in this
world is to do absolutely nothing until ordered, for a boy in motion is a liability to the peace and
property of the household.

36. The Double Standard of Hunting The father goes out with a gun and shoots a deer, and he is hailed
as a provider. The boy goes out with a slingshot and knocks a sparrow off a limb, and he is
scolded for cruelty. The boy is confused. Both animals are dead. The only difference seems to be the size of
the corpse and the utility of the meat. He learns that killing for the pot is a virtue, while killing
for skill is a vice. He reckons that morality is largely a matter of weight and measure, and that if
the sparrow weighed two hundred pounds, he would be a hero instead of a savage.

37. The Power of the Anonymous Note There is a dark power in the unsigned letter. A boy writes a note
to the schoolmaster saying, "Joe stole the chalk," and slips it under the door. He watches from his desk, innocent
as a lamb, as the storm breaks over Joe’s head. He feels a thrill of godlike power. He has directed
the lightning without getting wet. He knows it is cowardly, but he also knows it is effective. He learns that
the truth, when stripped of a signature, becomes a dangerous weapon that can destroy an enemy without risking a duel.
It is the preferred tactic of the weak and the clever.

38. The Bad Boy's Luck The Sunday School books teach that the Bad Boy will inevitably come to grief—he will drown,
or break his leg, or die lonely. The Good Boy will prosper. In reality, the boy observes that the town’s
worst hooligan—a boy who smokes, swears, and never washes—seems to lead a charmed life. He finds money in the road;
he never gets the measles; he catches the biggest fish. The Good Boy, meanwhile, gets the mumps and loses his
marbles. This empirical evidence shakes the boy’s faith in cosmic justice. He begins to suspect that Providence has a sneaking
admiration for the rascal, or at least finds him more entertaining to watch.

39. The Value of a Promise A promise is a currency that depreciates quickly. A boy promises his mother he will
be home by sunset. But then the fish start biting, or a woodchuck is sighted. The sun goes down. The
promise is broken. When he returns, he offers a new promise: "I will never do it again." He means it,
in the moment. But he knows, and his mother knows, that the future is a long time and full of
woodchucks. He learns that a promise is an intent, not a guarantee, and that the only way to keep a
promise perfectly is to never make one in the first place.

40. The Virtue of Ignorance There are times when knowing the truth is a liability. If a boy knows who broke
the window, he is faced with the terrible choice of being a "tattle-tale" or an accomplice. If he stays ignorant—if
he keeps his eyes on the ground and his ears shut—he is safe. He can honestly say, "I don't know."
He cultivates a studied blindness. He learns that in a community full of rules and infractions, the most moral position
is often one of total, deliberate stupidity. To know nothing is to be innocent; to know is to be involved,
and involvement always leads to trouble.

41. The Temperance Pledge Once a year, a man with a red nose and a loud voice comes to town to
warn against the evils of Strong Drink. He produces a paper called "The Pledge." He urges the boys to sign
it, swearing eternal abstinence from whiskey, wine, and beer. The boys, whose beverage experience is limited to milk and creek
water, sign with enthusiasm. They feel noble. They wear a blue ribbon. They look down on the town drunkard with
a new, holy disdain. They do not realize that signing a pledge against a temptation you have never felt is
the cheapest form of virtue. It is like a man in the desert swearing off swimming; it costs him nothing
and makes him feel superior to the fish.

42. The Ethics of "Playing Keeps" In the game of marbles, there are two moral systems: "Fun" and "Keeps." Playing for
Fun is a socialist utopia where property is returned at the end of the day. Playing for Keeps is capitalism
in its rawest form. When a boy loses his best taw (shooter) in a game of Keeps, he faces a
crisis. He begs for it back. He cries. He appeals to friendship. The winner stands firm on the letter of
the law. "You knew the rules," he says, pocketing the plunder. The loser walks away broken, having learned the hard
lesson that in the world of business, friendship is a fine sentiment, but a marble is a tangible asset.

43. The Forced Apology There is no lie more bitter than the forced apology. Two boys fight; noses are bloody. The
teacher drags them to the front and commands them to shake hands and say, "I am sorry." They do it.
They mutter the words while looking at the floor, their hearts filled with pure, unadulterated hate. They squeeze each other’s
hands hard enough to crack knuckles. It is a theatrical performance of peace. The teacher is satisfied, believing she has
restored harmony. The boys know better. They know they have merely postponed the war until recess, adding the sin of
hypocrisy to the original grievance.

44. The Morality of the Stray Cat A boy throws a rock at a stray cat, not to hit it, but
just to see it jump. He misses. The cat escapes. Later, the boy finds a bird with a broken wing.
He nurses it; he feeds it worms; he builds it a hospital in a shoe box. He weeps when it
dies. He is a paradox of cruelty and tenderness. He does not see the contradiction. The cat was a target;
the bird was a patient. His morality is determined not by the sanctity of life, but by the mood of
the moment and the cuteness of the victim. He is a benevolent despot, dispensing pain and mercy with equal whimsy.

45. The Sin of Ambition The parson preaches against ambition, calling it a snare of the devil. He tells the congregation
to be content with their lot. The boy listens, but he looks at the rich banker in the front pew,
who has a gold watch and a carriage. He looks at the parson, who has a shiny coat and walks.
He decides that while contentment may be a virtue in the next world, ambition seems to pay better dividends in
this one. He resolves to be ambitious enough to get the watch, and then he will become content enough to
enjoy it. It seems a sound theological compromise.

46. The Honor of the Gang A boy who will lie to his mother without blinking will never lie to his
Gang. If the group decides to raid a melon patch, and one boy is caught, he will endure the switch,
the lecture, and the solitary confinement without uttering a single name. To "squeal" is the only unforgivable sin. It is
a strange code. He betrays the laws of God and the State, but he keeps the law of the pirates.
He values the respect of three fellow outlaws more than the approval of all the angels in heaven. It proves
that for a boy, loyalty is a horizontal obligation, not a vertical one.

47. The Danger of the "Good Deed" The storybooks say that a good deed is its own reward. A boy decides
to test this. He sees a wagon stuck in the mud. He pushes with all his might. He gets covered
in muck. The horse kicks him. The driver yells at him to get out of the way. He walks home,
dirty and bruised, waiting for the warm glow of virtue to descend. It does not comes. Instead, his mother scolds
him for ruining his clothes. He concludes that the market for good deeds is depressed, and that next time he
will stand on the sidewalk and offer verbal encouragement, which is cleaner and safer.

48. The Superstition of the graveyard A boy does not fear the wrath of God as much as he fears the
ghosts of the graveyard. He will steal a pie on a Tuesday, but he will not walk past the cemetery
on a Friday night. His morality is geographic. He believes that the spirits of the dead are watching him, ready
to punish him for his sins. He behaves perfectly when passing the tombstones—he doesn't whistle, he doesn't spit. He is
a model citizen in the presence of the dead. It is a pity, he thinks, that the living don't inspire
the same level of terror, for he would be a much better boy if his parents were ghosts.

49. The Definition of "Fair" "Fair" is a word that changes shape depending on who is using it. When a boy
divides a cake, "fair" means two equal halves. When he chooses a team for baseball, "fair" means he gets the
best players. When he trades a broken knife for a working whistle, "fair" means he got the better of the
deal. He realizes that "fairness" is not an objective standard, but a rhetorical device used to justify getting what you
want. He appeals to it constantly when he is losing, and ignores it completely when he is winning.

50. The End of the Day Judgment When the boy lies in bed at night, reviewing the day’s ledger, he finds
a confusing balance sheet. He lied about the chores (Debit). He saved a drowning bug (Credit). He stole an apple
(Debit). He gave half to his friend (Credit). He tries to calculate if he is destined for the Good Place
or the Bad Place. The math is too hard. He decides to assume that God grades on a curve, and
that as long as he isn't as bad as the Jenkins boy down the street—who set fire to a barn
once—he is probably safe. He falls asleep, trusting in the mercy of a comparative standard.

51. The Ethics of "Borrowing" There is a fine line between stealing and borrowing, and a boy dances on it daily.
To take a neighbor’s saw without asking is stealing, provided you keep it. But if you take it with the
intention of returning it, it is merely borrowing, even if you leave it in the rain for three weeks until
it rusts solid. The boy rests his conscience on that invisible pillar of "Intention." He argues that he did not
steal the saw; he simply extended its residency. He learns that the road to moral ruin is paved not with
bad deeds, but with good intentions that got distracted by a fishing trip.

52. The Missionary vs. The Circus When the circus comes to town on the same week as the Missionary Drive, the
boy faces a fiscal crisis of the soul. He has one dime. He can save a soul in Africa, or
he can see the elephant. The choice is agonizing. He is told that the heathen are perishing for lack of
light. But he knows that the elephant will only be here for one day. He reasons that the heathen have
been in the dark for thousands of years and can surely wait until Tuesday, whereas the elephant is a fleeting
miracle. He buys the ticket, deciding that Providence would not have made elephants so interesting if He didn't want boys
to look at them.

53. The Mystery of the "Bad Word" A boy is taught that certain words are explosives that will blow his soul
to perdition. He guards his tongue. Then, one day, he helps his father fix a wagon wheel. The father pinches
his finger and lets fly a string of language that turns the air blue. The boy is stunned. He waits
for the lightning to strike. It does not. The sun continues to shine; the birds continue to sing. He realizes
that the prohibition on swearing is not a universal law, but a class distinction—it is a privilege reserved for adults
with crushed fingers. He feels a new respect for his father, not as a moral guide, but as a man
who knows the secret language of pain.

54. The Confession of the Half-Truth When cornered by authority, a boy knows that a full confession is suicide. A lie
is dangerous. The solution is the Half-Truth. If asked, "Did you break the window?" he answers, "I did not throw
the rock." This is technically true; he threw a clod of dirt that contained a rock. He takes refuge in
the technicality. He feels a glow of righteousness. He has not lied, yet he has deceived. He learns that the
most successful sinners are not the ones who break the law, but the ones who study the fine print and
find the loopholes that allow them to slip through the fingers of justice.

55. The Virtue of Poverty It is easy to be honest when you have nothing to steal. The boy observes that
the poorest family in town, who live in a shack by the river, never locks their door. The rich banker
locks his door, his windows, and his safe. The boy wonders if wealth is actually a hindrance to virtue. The
poor man has no fear of thieves because he has no property. The rich man suspects everyone. The boy decides
that while he would like to be rich, he would miss the luxury of trusting his neighbors. He reckons that
money costs a man his peace of mind, which is a high price to pay for a velvet coat.

56. The Eulogy Paradox The boy attends the funeral of a man known to be the meanest skinflint in the county.
He expects a sermon on the wages of sin. Instead, the preacher speaks of the man’s "frugality" and "prudence." He
paints a portrait of a saint. The boy looks at the coffin, then at the preacher. He wonders if there
has been a mistake and they are burying the wrong man. He realizes that the grave has a magical power
to scrub a reputation clean. He decides that if he wants to be well-spoken of, he doesn't need to be
good; he just needs to die, which seems like a drastic measure for a little praise.

57. The Luck of the Wicked The Sunday School books insist that the wicked stand in slippery places. The boy watches
the town gambler. He does not seem to slip. He wears fine boots, smokes good cigars, and always has a
dollar. The honest cobbler works eighteen hours a day and has a backache. The boy finds this distribution of rewards
confusing. He suspects that the "slippery places" are reserved for the next world, which is a long time to wait
for justice. He wonders if Providence is perhaps testing the righteous by letting the wicked have all the fun, just
to see who is truly loyal to the cause.

58. The Bargain with Providence In moments of extreme peril—like walking past a graveyard at midnight—a boy enters into a contract
with God. "Lord," he whispers, "if you get me past these tombstones, I will memorize a Psalm." He scampers past,
heart pounding. He survives. Now comes the debt. He looks at the Psalm. It is long. It has hard words.
He wonders if God really expects payment. He reasons that God is merciful and likely didn't hear him clearly in
the dark. He defaults on the loan. He learns that fear makes us religious, but safety makes us forgetful, and
that a scared boy is the most pious creature on earth for exactly five minutes.

59. The Betrayal of the Secret A secret is a heavy coin that burns a hole in the pocket. A boy
is told a juicy piece of gossip—that the schoolmaster wears a wig. He swears silence. But the pressure to tell
is immense. To know something that others do not is a form of power. He drops a hint. Then another.
Finally, he tells the whole story to his best friend, swearing him to secrecy. The friend tells another. Soon, the
whole town knows. The boy feels a twinge of guilt, but also a sense of relief. He learns that a
secret is like a captive bird; it is only a matter of time before it flies, and you might as
well be the one to open the cage.

60. The Morality of the Mob A boy who would never throw a rock at a window alone will happily do
it if five other boys are doing it. He loses his individual conscience in the collective roar. He feels no
guilt because "everybody was doing it." He learns that numbers dilute responsibility. If one boy does a bad thing, it
is a crime. If fifty boys do it, it is a "prank" or a "movement." He discovers the frightening truth
that morality is a solitary pursuit, and that the moment you join a crowd, you hang your conscience on a
peg outside the door and pick it up on the way out.

61. The Wisdom of the Old Sinner The town has an Old Man who sits on a barrel and whittles. He
was a terror in his youth—a drinker, a fighter, a rogue. Now he is gentle, kind, and full of good
advice. He tells the boys to stay on the straight and narrow. The boys admire his virtue. They do not
realize that his virtue is largely due to rheumatism. He is good because he is too tired to be bad.
The boy suspects that age does not cure sin; it simply takes away the energy to commit it. He hopes
that when he is old, he will have enough memories of wickedness to keep him warm while he is being
good.

62. The Final Ledger A boy grows up. He puts away his childish things—the slingshot, the stolen apple, the fear of
the dark. He enters the world of men, a world of contracts, laws, and taxes. He looks back on his
youth and realizes that his moral struggles were simple then. He knew what was right, even if he didn't do
it. Now, the lines are blurred. He compromises; he hedges; he justifies. He realizes that the conscience of a boy
is a sharp, clear bell, while the conscience of a man is a muffled drum. He smiles at his former
self, the little savage who stole a watermelon and worried about his soul, and wishes he could be that honest
sinner again.
