1. The Drum Major Instinct Every boy, at some point in his life, is seized by a burning ambition to be
a Drum Major. He does not wish to be the General, for the General sits on a horse and has
to worry about maps and cannonballs. The Drum Major, however, carries a baton and wears a hat as tall as
a beehive. He walks backward; he twirls his stick; he is the sun around which the army revolves. The boy
practices in the backyard with a broom handle, marching through the chickens with a strut that would shame a turkey
cock. He learns early that the world rewards the man who makes the most show, not necessarily the man who
does the most fighting, and that a gold tassel is worth more than a strategy.

2. The Glory of the Sore Toe It is a curious fact of boyhood that an injury is a source of
immense pride. If a boy stubs his toe and it must be wrapped in a rag, he becomes a personage
of distinction. He limps dramatically, even when no one is looking. At school, he sits with his foot on a
bench, the object of envious stares. Other boys gather around to inspect the bandage, offering him marbles for a peek
at the wound. He realizes that suffering, if displayed with sufficient theater, is a form of currency. He milks that
toe for a week, and when it finally heals, he feels a distinct sense of loss, having been demoted back
to the ranks of the able-bodied and uninteresting.

3. The Ambition of the Pirate The highest ambition of the male youth is not to be President, or a Banker,
or a Preacher. It is to be a Pirate. The Pirate is the ultimate symbol of success. He has no
boss; he washes only when he falls overboard; he is rich in Spanish doubloons. The boy stands on the riverbank,
looking at a log raft, and imagines himself the "Black Avenger of the Spanish Main." He plans to terrorize the
Sunday School picnic. He imagines the townspeople trembling at his name. It is a dream of pure power, untainted by
the necessity of learning arithmetic. He reckons that if he could just get a cutlass and a flag, the world
would finally give him the respect he deserves.

4. The Vanity of the New Suit When a boy gets his first suit with long trousers, he undergoes a chemical
change. He puts it on and stands before the mirror, admiring the sudden elongation of his legs. He feels he
has grown a foot in height. He walks to church not as a boy, but as a Monument. He expects
the traffic to stop. He expects the dogs to bow. He sits in the pew, stiff as a poker, terrified
of wrinkling his grandeur. He looks with pity on the boys in knee-breeches, forgetting that only yesterday he was one
of them. He learns that clothes do not make the man, but they certainly make the man think he is
better than his neighbors.

5. The Steamboat Fantasy In the river towns, there is only one ambition that counts: to be a Steamboatman. To stand
in the pilot house, surrounded by glass, smoking a cigar and ringing bells—that is the summit of human existence. The
pilot looks down on the world from his high perch. He knows the secrets of the river. When he walks
through town, he has a rolling gait that speaks of distant ports like St. Louis and New Orleans. The landlocked
boys watch him with hearts heavy with envy. They resolve to run away and become cabin boys, dreaming of the
day they can wear a blue coat with brass buttons and spit into the Mississippi with professional accuracy.

6. The Pride of the Elocutionist Once a year, the school holds an exhibition where children recite poetry to a captive
audience of sweating parents. The ambitious boy steps forward to recite "Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death." He bows
low. He gestures wildly. He roars; he whispers. He believes he is Patrick Henry reborn. The audience applauds politely, mostly
out of relief that he has finished. The boy, however, mistakes this for a triumph. He leaves the stage convinced
he is destined for the Senate. He does not know that his suspenders were unfastened the entire time, and that
his "death" scene was chiefly admired for the view of his shirt-tail.

7. The Deacon’s Strut The Deacon is a man who carries his piety like a heavy suitcase. He walks up the
aisle on Sunday with a solemnity that suggests he is personally responsible for the structural integrity of the church. He
passes the collection plate with a critical eye, noting who puts in a nickel and who puts in a button.
He sings the hymns louder than the choir, dragging the tempo to match his own dignity. The boy watches him
and wonders if God is impressed by this display, or if He, like the congregation, just wishes the Deacon would
sit down and stop creaking his boots.

8. The Envy of the "Town Character" Every town has a man who has been to the City and returned. He
is an object of intense local pride and jealousy. He wears a watch chain that looks like a ship's anchor.
He uses words like "metropolitan" and "haberdashery." He complains that the local coffee is swill. The townspeople gather around him
at the post office to hear his tales of gaslights and paved streets. The local boys imitate the way he
tilts his hat. He is a living reminder that there is a bigger world out there, and his presence makes
the village feel small, dusty, and inadequate.

9. The Tombstone Ambition It is a strange quirk of human nature that a man will spend his whole life pinching
pennies, denying himself every comfort, just so he can afford a large stone to sit on top of him when
he is dead. He picks out the granite with more care than he picked out his wife. He drafts an
epitaph that describes a man of generosity and warmth—a man no one in the town would recognize. He wants to
be the tallest thing in the graveyard. The boy walks through the cemetery, reading these lies carved in stone, and
wonders why people are so anxious to make a good impression on the worms.

10. The Fall of the Show-Off Ambition is a dangerous thing on a playground. A boy decides to show off for
a girl by walking on the top rail of a fence. He shouts, "Look at me!" He creates a moment
of high drama. He balances; he wavers. For a second, he is a king. Then gravity asserts its rights. He
falls into the briar patch. The girl laughs. The other boys cheer. He crawls out, scratched and humiliated, his ambition
crushed. He learns the hard lesson that the higher you climb to be seen, the harder the ground feels when
you arrive back at your natural level.

11. The Tyranny of the Spelling Bee There is no pride quite as brittle as that of the school spelling champion.
He stands at the head of the line, arms crossed, looking down on the lesser intellects who stumble over "separate"
and "receive." He is a king of syllables. He waits for his word with the arrogance of a duelist. The
teacher gives him "Phthisis." He smiles. He spells it. The audience gasps. He feels immortal. Then, in the next round,
he is felled by "Handkerchief," leaving out the "d." The fall is absolute. He walks back to his seat, a
dethroned monarch, realizing that the dictionary is a cruel master that waits for the moment of highest vanity to spring
its trap.

12. The Peril of the High-Wheeler A young man possessed by the ambition to look dashing will purchase a velocipede—one of
those machines with a wheel as tall as a house and a seat perched in the clouds. He mounts it
in the town square, conscious that every eye is upon him. He feels like a centaur. He pedals with a
haughty air, looking over the heads of the pedestrians. But the high-wheeler is a treacherous beast. It requires only a
single pebble to send the rider pitching forward over the handlebars. The resulting crash is not merely a physical calamity;
it is a social death. To lie in the dust, entangled in spokes, while the very people you meant to
impress help you up, is a cure for pride that no doctor can prescribe.

13. The Miracle of the First Shave The ambition to be a Man centers entirely on the upper lip. A boy
of fourteen examines his face in the mirror and detects a microscopic shadow. It is invisible to the naked eye,
but to him, it is a mustache. He steals his father’s razor. He lathers his face with the solemnity of
a surgeon. He scrapes at the peach fuzz. He cuts himself, naturally. He walks into breakfast with a piece of
paper stuck to his chin, bleeding but triumphant. He expects his family to treat him with new deference. Instead, his
mother asks if he scratched himself on a briar, and his father advises him to wait until he actually has
hair before he starts harvesting it.

14. The Genealogy Trap Every family in town claims to be descended from nobility. The Smiths claim a connection to a
Duke; the Joneses claim a connection to the Mayflower. They polish these ancestors like old silver. The boy listens to
his aunt brag about a Great-Uncle who was a General in the Revolution. She describes a hero of mythical proportions.
The boy later finds an old letter in a trunk revealing that the Great-Uncle was actually a cook who was
discharged for stealing a ham. He learns that family pride is largely a matter of creative editing, and that if
you shake any family tree hard enough, a few nuts are bound to fall out.

15. The Vanity of the Autograph A boy develops a sudden obsession with his own signature. He believes that one day,
this signature will be required on treaties and bank notes. He covers his slate, his books, and the barn door
with his name. He experiments with flourishes. He underlines it; he adds scrolls and swirls. He tries to make it
look illegible, believing that illegibility is the mark of genius. He creates a signature so complex that he cannot reproduce
it twice. He is preparing for a fame that has not yet arrived, unaware that the only place his signature
will likely appear for the next ten years is on a chore list he is trying to avoid.

16. The Brass Band Delusion When the town organizes a Brass Band, ambition runs high. Every man wants to play the
big bass drum. It is the instrument of authority; it makes the most noise and requires the least skill. The
man who secures the drum walks with a strut that threatens to dislocate his hips. He pounds it with a
fury that drowns out the melody. He believes he is the heart of the music. The cornet players, blue in
the face from actual effort, hate him. The drummer doesn't care. He knows that when the band marches down Main
Street, the girls are looking at the thunder, not the squeak, and he is the god of thunder.

17. The Intellectual Pose A young man decides he is a Philosopher. He buys a pair of spectacles he doesn't need.
He carries a heavy book of poetry under his arm, title out, so the world can see his depth. He
sits in the park, frowning at the horizon. He sighs frequently. He wants the town to think he is pondering
the Infinite. In reality, he is wondering what time supper is. He finds that looking deep is exhausting work. He
hopes a young lady will ask him what he is reading, but usually, the only person who speaks to him
is a stray dog looking for a sandwich, who is unimpressed by his intellect.

18. The Sunday Bonnet War The church is the battlefield of female ambition, and the weapon is the Bonnet. A woman
does not buy a hat to keep the sun off; she buys it to kill the spirit of Mrs. Miller
three pews back. She arrives late, so the entrance is dramatic. She sails down the aisle, a frigate of ribbons
and artificial fruit. She kneels to pray, but her eyes are scanning the room to see who has noticed the
ostrich feather. If she sees a hat taller than her own, her prayer becomes a grievance against the Almighty for
allowing such bad taste to prosper. The sermon on "Humility" bounces off her hat brim without leaving a scratch.

19. The Ambition of the "Expert" There is always a man who claims to be an Expert on watermelons, or horses,
or weather. He thumps a melon and pronounces it ripe with the authority of a Supreme Court judge. He holds
forth on the best way to shoe a mule. He predicts rain by the ache in his left elbow. His
pride is staked on his infallibility. When the melon turns out to be green, or the mule kicks him, or
the sun shines during his blizzard, he does not apologize. He claims the melon was picked wrong, the mule was
crazy, and the weather has changed its habits just to spite him. He is never wrong; the universe is simply
uncooperative.

20. The Local Politician The man who runs for the office of Town Constable undergoes a transformation. He was once a
simple grocer; now he is a Statesman. He shakes hands with people he used to ignore. He kisses babies that
are sticky with jam. He gives speeches from the back of a wagon, talking about "The Future" and "The Constitution"
when the job mostly involves chasing stray pigs. He swells with the dignity of office. He believes the eyes of
the nation are upon him. He wins by three votes and immediately buys a new coat, convinced that he is
now a pillar of history, while the town just hopes he can keep the pigs out of the courthouse.

21. The Poet of the Local Paper The most dangerous form of ambition is the literary kind. A young man falls
in love, or eats something indigestible, and decides he is a Poet. He writes a set of verses titled "To
a Dying Dove" or "The Maiden’s Tear." He rhymes "love" with "dove" and "sorrow" with "tomorrow" and feels he has
reinvented the English language. When the local newspaper prints it—usually to fill a blank space between the cattle prices and
the obituaries—his pride knows no bounds. He walks the streets waiting to be recognized as a Genius. He affects a
melancholy stare. He does not know that the town is using his masterpiece to wrap fish, and that the editor
only printed it because his father buys a lot of advertising.

22. The Duel of the Schoolyard Two boys decide to fight, not out of anger, but out of a mutual need
to establish a reputation for ferocity. They draw a line in the dirt. They circle each other like gamecocks. "You
step over that," says one. "You make me," says the other. They exchange insults of high caliber. They describe the
terrible violence they are about to inflict. It is a contest of imagination rather than fisticuffs. Both are secretly praying
for the school bell to ring or for a teacher to intervene. When the bell finally rings, they part with
dark threats of "next time," both walking away with their skins intact and their honor satisfied, having survived a war
that consisted entirely of adjectives.

23. The Vanity of the Watch-Chain A man may have no money in the bank, and holes in his socks, but
if he has a gold watch-chain draped across his vest, he feels solvent. The chain is the flag of his
prosperity. He fingers it constantly. He pulls out the watch to check the time when he already knows it is
noon. If he has no watch, he hangs the chain anyway, attached to a button or a heavy stone in
his pocket. It is a bluff played against the world. He hopes the glint of gold will blind the neighbors
to the fact that his coat is shiny at the elbows, proving that in society, the appearance of assets is
often more important than the assets themselves.

24. The House with the Tower When a man makes a little money, his first instinct is to inflict architecture upon
his neighbors. He builds a house with a Tower. The tower serves no purpose; it is too small for a
bedroom and too hot for a study. It is simply a wooden exclamation point. He stands in the road and
admires it. He believes he is living in a castle. The neighbors look at it and wonder if he intends
to shoot arrows at the tax collector. The tower stands there, leaking in the rain and roasting in the sun,
a monument to the fact that a man’s ambition often exceeds his common sense—and his roofline.

25. The Tragedy of the "Spirited" Horse A young man wishes to be seen as a cavalier. He buys a horse
that is advertised as "spirited." He envisions himself galloping through town, hair flying, controlling the beast with a wrist of
iron. The horse, however, is not spirited; it is merely malicious. It waits until they are in front of the
church on Sunday morning. Then, it decides to dance. It walks sideways; it backs into a buggy; it tries to
climb a tree. The young man clings to the mane, his hat over his eyes, his dignity gone. He learns
that a "spirited" horse is just a four-legged critic of human vanity, designed to turn a hero into a laughingstock.

26. The Orator’s Downfall The Fourth of July orator steps onto the platform, swelling with the magnitude of his subject. He
intends to soar like an eagle. He uses words like "sanguinary," "aggrandizement," and "shibboleth," having no clear idea what they
mean but liking the sound of them. He gestures toward the horizon. He is halfway through a sentence about the
"blood-stained banner of liberty" when a stray dog wanders onto the stage and begins to scratch a flea with rhythmic
thumping. The audience’s attention shifts instantly from the eagle to the dog. The orator roars; the dog thumps. The dog
wins. The speaker learns that no amount of eloquence can compete with a low-comedy animal.

27. The Pride of the First Dollar There is a specific frame for the First Dollar a man ever earns. He
nails it to the wall. He looks at it with reverence. It is not currency; it is a holy relic.
It proves he is a Producer, a Captain of Industry. He bores his guests with the story of how he
earned it—usually by shoveling something unpleasant or selling something useless. He ignores the fact that he has since spent a
thousand dollars on foolishness. That single bill on the wall remains pure, a symbol of the time when he was
industrious, thrifty, and full of promise, before he discovered the expensive joys of cigars and billiards.

28. The Social Climber’s Dinner The ambitious wife decides to give a "High Tea" to impress the local gentry. She creates
sandwiches the size of postage stamps. She borrows silver from her aunt. She forces her husband into a stiff collar
that makes him look like a strangled goose. She invites the Judge and the Banker. The atmosphere is as relaxed
as a court martial. Everyone sits on the edge of their chairs, terrified of dropping a crumb. The conversation dies.
The only sound is the ticking of the clock and the husband’s stomach growling. She considers it a triumph because
the Judge came, even if he did leave early to get a square meal at the tavern.

29. The Burden of the Medal A soldier returns from the war with a medal. It is a fine thing, bronze
and shiny. At first, he wears it only on holidays. Then, finding that it buys him drinks, he begins to
wear it on Tuesdays. He tells the story of how he won it. The story grows. At first, he charged
a trench; by the third year, he captured a regiment single-handed. The medal becomes heavy. He has to live up
to it. He cannot just be a man who farms corn; he has to be a Hero. He realizes that
a reputation for bravery is a hard thing to maintain in peacetime, especially when the only enemy left is a
potato bug.

30. The Snobbery of the City Cousin The City Cousin comes to visit the country relations. He brings a cane, which
is useless in mud, and a monocle, which is useless everywhere. He looks at the farm with a benevolent sneer.
He asks if the cows are dangerous. He complains about the silence. The country boys watch him with a mixture
of awe and contempt. They know he cannot swim, shoot, or ride, but he knows how to order oysters in
French. He parades his ignorance as if it were a virtue. The country boys wait for the inevitable moment when
he steps in something soft in the barnyard, proving that a city education is no defense against the realities of
agriculture.

31. The Returned Traveler A man goes to Europe—or perhaps just to St. Louis—for a month, and he returns a stranger
to his own country. He suddenly finds the local butter "indifferent" and the roads "barbarous." He peppers his conversation with
French phrases like oui and garçon, usually pronouncing them with a flat vowel that would make a Frenchman weep. He
affects a weariness with the provincial life. The townspeople listen to his tales of cathedrals and kings with open mouths,
while the older men spit tobacco juice and remember when he used to run around in his shirt-tail stealing apples.
He has not actually become more refined; he has simply acquired a more expensive way of being annoying.

32. The Choir Leader’s Baton The leader of the church choir possesses a vanity that is out of all proportion to
his materials. He stands before a group of six elderly ladies and the town butcher, yet he waves his baton
with the fury of a man conducting a symphony of a thousand souls. He scowls at the sopranos; he hushes
the bass. He wipes his brow with a dramatic handkerchief between hymns. He believes he is shaping art. The congregation,
however, knows that no amount of waving will ever make Mrs. Higgins hit the high notes, but they let him
have his glory, for it is the only time in the week he gets to tell a woman to be
quiet.

33. The Studio Portrait When a man decides to have his likeness taken, he is seized by an ambition to look
like a Roman Senator. He goes to the photographer’s studio and selects his props. He leans against a broken column.
He holds a book he has never read. He stares into the middle distance with a look of profound wisdom,
as if he is solving the problems of the universe. The photographer clamps his head in a metal brace to
keep him still. The result is a picture of a man who looks stiff, frightened, and slightly cross-eyed. Yet he
hangs it in the parlor, convinced that posterity will gaze upon it and say, "There stood a Giant."

34. The Boy with a Job The moment a boy secures a position—perhaps sweeping out the grocery store or delivering the
gazette—he resigns from the human race. He walks past his former playmates, who are shooting marbles in the dust, with
the chilly nod of a Banker passing a beggar. He is a "Man of Business." He has no time for
frivolity. He jingles the three nickels in his pocket to make sure the world hears his capital. He speaks of
"commercial interests" and "the state of trade." He is insufferable for exactly two weeks, until he gets fired for eating
the inventory, at which point he happily rejoins the marble game as if nothing happened.

35. The Scientific Bump-Reader Every few years, a Phrenologist comes to town, a man who claims to read character by the
bumps on the skull. The ambitious citizens line up to have their heads mapped. The Phrenologist runs his hands over
the grocer’s head and declares he has a large "Bump of Benevolence." The grocer beams, forgetting that he puts sand
in his sugar. He finds a "Bump of Logic" on the town fool. The subjects pay their dollar and leave
with a chart proving they are geniuses in disguise. It is a marvelous science, for it tells a man exactly
what he wants to hear, and attributes all his failures to the shape of his bone rather than the laziness
of his spirit.

36. The Mustache Cup There is a specific vessel designed for the man who values his dignity above his thirst: the
Mustache Cup. It has a porcelain bridge across the top to protect the gentleman’s whiskers from the tea. To drink
from it requires a specific tilt of the head and a look of extreme concentration. The man who uses it
feels he is the height of sophistication. He is guarding his greatest asset. The boy watches this ritual and wonders
why a man would grow a hedge on his lip if it requires special furniture to navigate around it. He
concludes that the mustache is a jealous master that demands constant tribute, even at breakfast.

37. The Pew Cushion War In the meeting-house, spiritual rank is determined by the upholstery. The common pews are hard pine,
designed to keep the sinner awake through pain. But the ambitious families bring their own cushions. Red velvet signifies a
family of substance; needlepoint signifies old money. The arrival of a new, thicker cushion is a declaration of war. Mrs.
Miller sees Mrs. Brown’s new plush seat and immediately begins stitching something higher and softer. The boy sits on the
hard wood, squirming, and watches the aristocracy recline on their pillows. He suspects that while the meek may inherit the
earth, the comfortable will likely sleep through the sermon.

38. The "Almost" Rich Man Every town has a man whose pride is built on a foundation of "Almost." He almost
bought the land where the railroad station is. He almost invested in the patent medicine that made a million. He
tells these stories with a tragic swagger. He wants credit for the fortune he missed. He acts as if he
is rich, by virtue of having been close to it. He treats the actual rich men with familiarity, as fellow
members of the club. The town listens patiently, knowing that "Almost" buys no groceries, but allowing him his dignity because
a man with a near-miss is more entertaining than a man with no aim at all.

39. The Vanity of the Signature There comes a time when a man decides his handwriting is too plain for his
station. He adopts a "Spencerian" script. He adds loops to his L's and tails to his Y's that wrap around
the entire page. He signs a receipt for a bag of flour with a flourish worthy of the Declaration of
Independence. It takes him two minutes to write his name. The clerk cannot read it. The man is pleased. He
believes that illegibility is the hallmark of greatness. He looks at his own signature, a tangled nest of ink, and
sees not a mess, but the autograph of a man who is too important to lift his pen from the
paper.

40. The Glory of the Funeral A man may live a humble life, but his ambition often reserves its remaining strength
for his funeral. He joins lodges and societies solely for the promise of a uniformed escort to the grave. He
saves money for a coffin with silver handles. He wants a procession that blocks traffic for three blocks. It is
the final vanity. He wants to inconvenience his neighbors one last time. The boy watches the hearse go by, with
its black plumes and solemn horses, and thinks it is a grand show, though he reckons it is a pity
the guest of honor is the only one who can't sit up and enjoy the attention.

41. The Debate Society The young men of the town form a Debating Society to improve their minds, or so they
claim. In truth, they meet to hear themselves talk. They debate questions like "Is Fire more destructive than Water?" with
the gravity of the Roman Senate. The ambitious youth stands up, hooks his thumbs in his vest, and unleashes a
torrent of polysyllabic words he found in a dictionary. He does not care about the argument; he cares about the
sound of his own baritone. He mispronounces "hegemony" and "superfluous," but he says them with such conviction that the audience
nods in agreement. He leaves the hall convinced he is a statesman, when he is merely a noise.

42. The "Imported" Wife A local boy goes to the City to make his fortune and returns with a Wife. This
is a moment of high tension. The town waits to judge her. She arrives wearing a hat with a bird
on it that no local woman would dare to wear. She walks with a mince. She looks at the mud
on the street with a delicate shudder. The local boy beams with pride; he has captured a rare specimen. He
parades her through the general store. But the town matrons watch from behind their curtains, their lips pursed, deciding that
her waist is too small and her hands too white for honest work, and that pride goeth before a burnt
biscuit.

43. The Vanity of the Walking Stick A young man who has no infirmity whatsoever will purchase a cane. It is
not for support; it is for punctuation. He twirls it. He leans on it while talking to ladies. He points
at distant objects with it. He feels it gives him an air of European leisure. The cane is a difficult
accessory; it trips him on stairs; it slides away when he leans on it, nearly sending him into the mud.
Yet he persists. He believes the cane transforms him from a clerk into a Gentleman. The dogs of the town,
however, view the stick as a threat and the man as a target, leading to a dignity-destroying chase down Main
Street.

44. The Grand Wizard of the Lodge The grocer is a humble man who weighs cheese for a living. But on
Tuesday nights, he puts on a velvet collar and becomes the "Grand Imperial Potentate" of the local Lodge. He holds
a scepter. He memorizes secret passwords that sound like gibberish. He refuses to let anyone enter without the special knock.
In the daylight, he is a servant of the public; in the dark, he is a King. The Lodge allows
grown men to play dress-up and pretend that their secret handshakes rule the world. It is a harmless delusion that
allows the Potentate to survive the indignity of selling turnips for another week.

45. The Agricultural Vanity A farmer who is modest about his children will lose all perspective when it comes to a
Pumpkin. He grows one the size of a beer barrel. He nurses it like an invalid. He covers it with
blankets at night. He brings it to the County Fair on a wagon, sitting beside it with a shotgun to
deter rivals. When he wins the Blue Ribbon, his chest swells until his buttons pop. He accepts the congratulations of
the crowd as if he had written Hamlet. He has created a vegetable that is too big to cook and
too heavy to move, but to him, it is the apex of civilization.

46. The Traveling "Professor" A stranger arrives in town calling himself "Professor" Vanderhoof. He claims to teach Penmanship, or Mesmerism, or
Phrenology. He has long hair and a greasy coat. The town treats him with the awe reserved for royalty. He
uses words like "ethereal" and "magnetic." The ambitious mothers flock to him, paying good money to have him examine their
sons. The "Professor" takes the money, flatters the mothers, and eats all the pies he can beg. He is a
fraud of the first water, but the town is so hungry for a touch of "Culture" that they will swallow
any hook, provided the bait is shiny enough.

47. The New Buggy A man decides to ruin his finances by purchasing a shiny new buggy with red wheels. He
drives it to church, making sure to arrive just as the bells stop ringing. He sits up straight, holding the
whip at a jaunty angle. He wants the neighbors to see the varnish catch the sun. He is not driving
a vehicle; he is driving his own ego. He refuses to give a ride to the weary walker, lest the
dust soil the cushions. He is the envy of the parish for exactly one week, until the mud splashes the
red wheels and the varnish cracks, revealing that underneath the glory, it is just a wagon like any other.

48. The Family Crest There is a certain type of woman who suddenly discovers she needs a Coat of Arms. She
hires a man in Boston to "research" her lineage. He sends back a drawing of a shield with a lion
and a Latin motto that means "Victory or Death." She paints this on her carriage. She stamps it on her
stationery. She does not know that the crest actually belongs to a family in Wales who went extinct in 1400,
or that the "lion" looks suspiciously like a poodle. She is happy. She has bought a history for five dollars,
proving that nobility is the easiest thing in the world to acquire if you don't ask too many questions.

49. The Graduation Speech The Valedictorian steps to the podium. He is eighteen. He has never traveled further than the county
seat. Yet, he feels qualified to advise the audience on "The Destiny of Nations." He speaks of "embarking on the
sea of life" and "climbing the mountain of success." He uses metaphors that collide with each other and sink. He
is bursting with the pride of ignorance. The audience fans themselves and nods, remembering their own graduation speeches, and knowing
that life will soon knock that poetry out of him with the handle of a shovel.

50. The Autograph Album The young lady keeps an Album. Her ambition is to fill it with the names of the
Great. When a minor celebrity—a Congressman or a traveling magician—comes to town, she hunts him down. She presents her book.
She begs for a sentiment. She values the page not for the wisdom written there, but for the trophy of
the name. She displays the book to her rivals. "See," she says, "I have met the man who swallowed the
sword." She collects people like butterflies, pinning them to the page to prove that she, too, has brushed against the
hem of greatness.

51. The Vanity of the Private Printing There is a man who believes he has written the Great American Novel. The
publishers, being short-sighted fools, refuse to print it. So, the man pays for it himself. He receives a crate of
five hundred copies. He stacks them in the parlor. He gives them to friends, who thank him profusely and then
use the books to prop up uneven table legs. He walks the town with the air of an Author. He
waits for the critics to discover him. He does not know that the only person who has read the book
is his mother, and even she skipped the long descriptions of the sunset. He learns that you can buy paper
and ink, but you cannot buy an audience.

52. The Man Who Refuses Spectacles A man reaches the age where his arms are not long enough to read the
newspaper. But his pride refuses to admit defeat. He will not wear spectacles. He claims they are for old men.
He holds the paper at arm's length; he squints; he contorts his face. He reads the cattle prices as the
obituaries. He walks into a lamp post because he thought it was a friend. He endures headaches and humiliation rather
than surrender to a piece of glass. He believes he is fooling the world into thinking he is young, while
the world watches him trying to thread a needle for twenty minutes and laughs.

53. The Ambition of the "Funny Man" Every social gathering is plagued by the "Funny Man." His ambition is to make
the room explode with mirth. He memorizes jokes from the almanac. He plays practical jokes involving chairs and water buckets.
He laughs louder than anyone else at his own wit. He is a terror. He mistakes politeness for popularity. If
a girl smiles nervously, he thinks he has conquered her heart. He does not realize that the room breathes a
sigh of relief when he leaves. He is a slave to the laugh, and he will sacrifice his dignity, his
friends, and the china to get it.

54. The Rivalry of the Rose Bushes Two neighbors, otherwise sane men, enter into a duel of vegetation. Mr. Brown buys
a rose bush. Mr. Green buys a larger one. They water, they prune, they fertilize with secret mixtures. They stand
at the fence, glaring at each other’s blooms. It is not a love of nature; it is a war of
ego. If a blight attacks Mr. Brown’s bush, Mr. Green feels a secret, shameful joy. They spend their summers fighting
aphids and mildew, not for the beauty of the flower, but for the satisfaction of saying, "My red is redder
than your red." They are slaves to a thorny stick.

55. The Pride of the Secret Recipe A woman possesses a receipt for a fruitcake that has been in her family
for generations. She guards it like a state secret. She refuses to write it down. When asked for the ingredients,
she smiles vividly and says, "A little of this and a little of that." She brings the cake to the
church social, waiting for the praise. She wants the other women to despair. She believes the cake proves her moral
superiority. She does not know that the other women find the cake dry and heavy, and that they only eat
it to avoid a diplomatic incident. Her pride is built on a foundation of unswallowed crumbs.

56. The Vanity of the Heavy Watch A young man inherits his grandfather’s watch. It is as big as a turnip
and weighs a pound. He wears it in his vest pocket, where it drags him down on one side. He
pulls it out every five minutes. He snaps the lid open with a loud click. He frowns at the dial.
He winds it with a key that looks like a crank. He feels that this machine gives him gravity. He
is the Keeper of Time. He does not care that it loses twenty minutes a day and makes him late
for everything; the important thing is that it looks like it cost a fortune and makes a noise like a
threshing machine.

57. The Ambition of Eccentricity A man with no natural talent decides to become a "Character." He adopts a quirk. He
carries an umbrella on sunny days. He wears a winter coat in July. He talks to birds. He wants the
town to point and say, "There goes old Judge Bumble, he’s a queer one." He mistakes oddity for personality. He
believes that by breaking the rules of sensible dress, he is showing a great mind. In reality, he is just
hot and uncomfortable. He learns that true eccentricity is unconscious, while the manufactured kind is just a desperate cry for
attention from a boring man.

58. The Political Handshake The candidate for County Clerk develops a handshake that is a work of art. It is not
a grip; it is an embrace. He grabs the voter’s hand, pumps it, covers it with his other hand, and
looks deep into the victim’s eyes with moist affection. He asks about the wife and the hogs. He exudes a
slimy warmth. He believes this proves he is a "Man of the People." The voter extracts his hand, checking to
see if his fingers are still there, and wipes it on his trousers. The candidate moves on, unaware that his
touch feels less like brotherhood and more like a pickpocket at work.

59. The Monument in the Square The town decides to build a monument to its Founder. A committee is formed. The
ambition is to build something taller than the monument in the rival town. They collect pennies. They argue over the
design. Should he be on a horse? Should he be holding a scroll? They finally erect a stone soldier that
looks nothing like the Founder and everything like a generic statue ordered from a catalogue. They unveil it with speeches.
They swell with civic pride. Within a week, the pigeons have taken over, and the town forgets the Founder again,
but they remain proud that their slab of granite is six inches higher than the one in Shelbyville.

60. The "Self-Made" Myth (Revisited) The rich man sits in his library, surrounded by leather books he hasn't read, and dictates
his memoirs. He titles the chapter "My Struggle." He describes how he started with one suspender button and conquered the
world. He omits the loan from his uncle. He omits the panic that ruined his competitors. He paints a portrait
of inevitable genius. He believes it. He reads it to his wife, who nods and counts her stitches. He is
building a statue of himself out of words, unaware that the town remembers when he sold bad whiskey to the
Indians and calls him by a nickname he would pay a thousand dollars to erase.

61. The Vanity of Grief Even in mourning, pride finds a foothold. The widow buys the blackest veil in the store.
She weeps louder than anyone at the graveside. She competes for the title of Most Bereaved. She wants the town
to see the depth of her suffering. She faints on cue. It is a performance. She feels that a quiet
grief is insufficient tribute to her own capacity for feeling. She turns the funeral into a theater piece where she
is the star, proving that the human ego is so robust it can even use a coffin as a stage
prop.

62. The Conclusion of the Peacock The boy grows old. The strut slows down. The ambition to be a Pirate fades;
the ambition to be President fades. He looks in the mirror and sees a face that is not famous, not
rich, and not particularly handsome. He sees the lines where the laughter and the worry have been. He realizes that
all his strutting was for nothing—the world did not stop to watch. But he also realizes that the strutting was
the fun part. The vanity, the foolishness, the dreams of glory—they were the fuel that kept him moving. He smiles
at his reflection, adjusts his tie one last time, and decides that if he can’t be a King, he can
at least be a clean-shirted Commoner, which is a noble enough ambition for any man.
