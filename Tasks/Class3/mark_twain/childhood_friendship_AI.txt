1. The Natural Savage It is a curious fact of nature that a boy is born with a deep and abiding
suspicion of civilization. While his mother labors to make him presentable to the public—scrubbing the neck, combing the hair, and
forcing the feet into stiff leather—the boy knows this for what it is: a disguise. In his natural state, a
boy is a creature of mud and noise. He is most at home when he is least clean. Friendship, therefore,
usually begins in the mutual recognition of dirt. Two boys who meet while wearing their Sunday best will eye each
other with the distrust of rival bankers; but let those same two meet by a muddy creek with a frog
in hand, and they are brothers before the sun sets. The frog is the great equalizer of men.

2. The Currency of the Pocket To the adult eye, the contents of a boy’s pocket are nothing but trash—a piece
of blue glass, a spool of thread, a dead beetle, and a knife with half a blade. But to the
boy, this is capital. He knows that a white-alley marble is worth exactly two fishhooks, and a fishhook is worth
a look at a sore toe. Friendship is often cemented through the high finance of trade. To give a fellow
a bite of your apple—even the core—is a sign of regard; to trade him a genuine Barlow knife is a
marriage contract. Adults hoard gold, which is cold and useless, while boys hoard things of practical value, like a piece
of licorice that has gathered a little lint but still retains its flavor.

3. The Burden of the Collar There is no torture invented by the Inquisition that compares to the starch in a
Sunday collar. It saws at the neck and reminds the wearer that he is currently a prisoner of politeness. A
true friend is the one who understands this suffering without a word. When two boys sit in the back of
the church, suffering under the drone of a sermon that lasts longer than a drought, they share a silent communion
of misery. They do not need to speak to know that the moment they are released, they will run until
their lungs burn, just to shake off the holiness. The best friendships are often forged in the fires of enforced
boredom.

4. The Virtue of the "Bad" Boy Every town has a model boy—the one who studies his lessons, never tears his
trousers, and says "Yes, ma'am" with sickening regularity. And every other boy in town hates him with a pure and
holy passion. The true hero of the neighborhood is the boy who has been forbidden. He smokes corn-silk behind the
barn, he knows swear words that would blister a petunia, and he has a scar from a fight he didn't
start but definitely finished. To be seen with him is to risk the hickory switch at home, which makes his
company irresistible. Friendship with the pariah is the first step a boy takes toward declaring his independence from his mother’s
apron strings.

5. The Sacred Oath A promise made by a lawyer on paper is a flimsy thing, liable to be broken for
a dollar. But a promise made between two boys, sealed with a specific and grisly ritual, is binding unto death.
Whether it is crossing hearts or, in extreme cases, mixing a drop of blood, the oath is the bedrock of
society. If a boy reveals the location of the secret hideout or, heaven forbid, tells the teacher who put the
snake in her desk, he is a marked man. There is no court of appeals for the snitch. He is
cast out, distinct and separate, like a leper. The moral code of childhood is harsh, but it is clear: loyalty
is the only currency that does not depreciate.

6. The Utility of the Dog A boy’s best friend is rarely another human being; humans are unpredictable and prone to
scolding. A yellow dog, however, is a philosopher and a gentleman. He does not ask where you have been, nor
does he criticize the hole in your stocking. He is simply glad that you exist. A boy and his dog
can sit on a hillside for three hours doing absolutely nothing, and both will feel it was time well spent.
The dog is the only creature who views the boy not as a project to be improved, but as a
god to be worshipped. When a boy’s heart is broken by the fickleness of the world, it is the cold
nose of the dog that convinces him to go on living.

7. The Schoolhouse Prison The schoolhouse is built on the assumption that a boy’s natural spirit must be broken before it
can be useful. The teacher is the warden, and the slate board is the instrument of torture. Friendships in this
environment are formed in the trenches. Passing a note under the desk is a high-stakes operation requiring the stealth of
a spy. A cough used to cover a friend's lack of an answer is an act of supreme charity. The
shared hatred of long division binds souls together more tightly than love ever could. To see a friend called to
the front of the room to be disciplined is to feel the lash on your own back; it creates a
solidarity against the tyranny of the alphabet.

8. The Art of the Fight It is a mistake to think that fighting is the opposite of friendship. Among boys,
a fistfight is often just a very energetic conversation. Two boys may roll in the dust, tearing shirts and bloodying
noses, over a disagreement regarding the ownership of a hickory nut. Yet, ten minutes later, they are walking home with
arms slung over shoulders, sharing the same nut. The fight clears the air. It establishes a pecking order and proves
that both parties have grit. A boy who will not fight is viewed with suspicion, for he has no passion;
but a boy who fights and then bears no grudge is the salt of the earth.

9. The Mystery of Girls For the first decade of life, the female of the species is regarded as a nuisance—a
creature who tells on you for climbing trees and screams at the sight of a glorious spider. She is to
be avoided at all costs. But then, a strange sickness sets in. The boy finds himself combing his hair without
being asked. He starts walking on his hands or jumping over fences whenever a certain calico dress goes by. His
friends view this behavior with alarm, as if he has caught a fever. The intrusion of "love" is the great
wrecker of brotherhoods. One minute you have a reliable first lieutenant for your pirate crew; the next, he is picking
flowers and looking foolish.

10. The Pirate Crew Every group of friends is, in their own minds, a band of outlaws. They may be tasked
with weeding the garden, but in their heads, they are sailing the Spanish Main under the black flag. The mundane
world is painted over with the brush of imagination. A raft made of three rotten logs is a man-of-war; a
hillock of dirt is a fortress. This shared delusion is the magic of childhood. It requires a mutual agreement to
ignore the reality of dinner bells and bedtime. A friend is someone who does not laugh when you say you
are the King of France; he simply asks where your sword is.

11. The Curse of the Good Example There is always one mother in the village who insists on dressing her son
in white linen and parading him before the congregation as a standard of purity. This boy is a public menace.
His clean face is a silent rebuke to every other boy who has managed to get axle grease on his
ear by nine in the morning. Parents use this white-clad phantom as a bludgeon, asking, "Why cannot you be like
little Georgie?" They do not know that Georgie is despised by his peers and will likely be pummeled the moment
he is out of his mother's sight. Friendship cannot exist with perfection; it requires a mutual confession of flaws. A
boy with no stains on his character has no character at all.

12. The Midnight Whistle There is a specific sound, known only to the initiated, that signals a jailbreak. It is the
low, two-note whistle beneath a bedroom window at midnight. It wakes a boy from the deepest sleep, sharper than any
alarm. It means that the moon is out, the parents are snoring, and adventure is afoot. To slide down the
drainpipe and meet a comrade in the dark is to enter a secret world that belongs only to the young.
The night air tastes sweeter than the day, primarily because breathing it is forbidden. In these stolen hours, a boy
feels he is the master of the earth, unaware that he will likely fall asleep in his arithmetic lesson the
next morning.

13. The Superstition of Warts Science is a fine thing for schoolmasters, but for the serious business of life, a boy
relies on darker powers. If a boy has a wart, he knows that a doctor is useless. What is required
is a dead cat and a graveyard at midnight, or perhaps spunk-water found in a rotten stump. These remedies are
traded in whispers, like state secrets. If a friend tells you that burying a marble will make two more appear,
you do not question his logic; you grab a shovel. To doubt a superstition is to invite bad luck, and
no boy is willing to risk that. The world is full of ghosts and signs, and a true friend is
one who will help you chant the incantation without laughing.

14. The Tyranny of the Sunday Suit If clothes make the man, then the Sunday suit makes the martyr. It is
stiff, it itches, and it smells of mothballs and piety. When a boy is encased in this armor, he loses
the power of natural movement. He walks like a wooden soldier. A group of boys standing outside the church in
their finery look like a gathering of uncomfortable statues. They eye each other with sympathy, knowing they are all thinking
the same thought: how to get out of these shackles and into a creek without leaving a stain that will
result in a sermon at dinner. The destruction of a good pair of trousers is the inevitable result of a
healthy afternoon.

15. The Value of a Dead Rat To a civilized person, a dead rat on a string is a horror. To
a boy, it is a scepter of power. With it, he can clear a room of girls in three seconds
flat. He can terrorize the schoolmarm and gain a reputation for fearlessness. If a friend offers you the chance to
swing the rat, it is a high honor. It signifies that he trusts you with his most potent weapon. These
grotesque treasures—a snake skin, a bat’s wing, a tooth—are the artifacts of a world where the gross and the fascinating
are one and the same. They are the only things a boy possesses that an adult actually fears.

16. The Great Runaway Plot At least once a summer, every pair of friends will solemnly decide that they have endured
enough of civilization. The tyranny of having to wash behind the ears becomes too much to bear. They lay plans
to run away—to become pirates, or Indians, or perhaps circus performers. They pack a handkerchief with a crust of bread,
a stolen pie, and a blanket. They march into the woods with their hearts full of glory, determined never to
return. Usually, this resolve lasts until the sun goes down and the woods get quiet and full of strange noises.
Then, the call of a warm supper suddenly seems more heroic than starving on a damp rock. They return, not
as failures, but as men who have looked the world in the eye and decided to give it a second
chance.

17. The Glory of Whitewash Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do, and play consists of whatever a
body is not obliged to do. A smart boy knows that the difference lies entirely in the attitude. If you
can convince your friend that painting a fence is a rare privilege, a feat of artistic skill that not just
anyone is permitted to attempt, he will not only do the work for you but will pay you for the
opportunity. This is the great secret of human psychology: we covet what is difficult to attain. The boy who sits
on a barrel eating an apple while his friends sweat over his chores has learned a lesson in management that
will serve him better than any Latin conjugation.

18. The Solemnity of the Funeral Boys are morbid creatures. They have a fascination with death that would worry a preacher.
Let a stray dog die, or a bird fall from a nest, and they will organize a funeral that rivals
a state occasion. They will construct a coffin out of a cigar box, preach a sermon that mixes scripture with
pirate slang, and erect a marker. It is a play-act, yes, but it is done with a grave seriousness. In
these moments, they are rehearsing for the sorrows of the world, trying on the clothes of grief to see how
they fit. A friend who laughs during the burial of a beetle is no friend at all; he lacks the
proper sense of occasion.

19. The Code of Silence There comes a time when a window is broken, or a cat is painted blue, and
the figure of Authority descends with a switch, demanding to know the culprit. This is the test of fire. The
Code of Silence is absolute. A boy must stand and deliver a lie with the face of a cherub, or
else say nothing at all. To point the finger at a comrade is to commit social suicide. Even if you
are innocent, you take the licking if necessary. The pain of the switch fades in an hour, but the shame
of being a "tattle-tale" lasts until long trousers. It is better to weep in pain than to walk in shame.

20. The Unreachable Horizon There is a hill or a bend in the river that marks the edge of the known
world. Beyond it lies the Territory—a place of myth, where the fish are bigger and the rules don't apply. Friends
will spend hours speculating on what is over that ridge. They talk of building a raft and floating until they
reach the ocean. They never do it, of course; dinner time always intervenes. But the shared dream of the Territory
is what keeps them going. It is the belief that somewhere, just out of reach, there is a life without
schoolbooks or shoes, waiting for them to arrive and claim their kingdom.

21. The Peacock Display When a girl of a certain age walks past a group of boys, a sudden and violent
madness descends upon them. A boy who was previously sitting quietly will essentially lose his mind. He will begin to
shout for no reason, throw rocks at a distant bird, or attempt to walk on his hands while balancing a
stick on his nose. He does not know why he does this; he only knows that he must prove he
is dangerous and agile. His friends, rather than mocking him, will immediately join in, creating a cacophony of screeching and
tumbling. It is the human equivalent of a rooster flapping its wings, though with considerably less dignity. The girl, for
her part, usually walks by without turning her head, leaving the boys sweating and triumphant in their own confusion.

22. The High-Water Mark Cleanliness is a state that is forced upon a boy against his will, and he resists it
with the cunning of a fox. When sent to wash for dinner, he creates a masterpiece of deception. He wets
the face and the hands, leaving a distinct line of demarcation at the wrists and the neck. Below this line
is the pale skin of civilization; above it is the undisturbed grime of the day. This "high-water mark" is a
point of pride. It proves that while he submitted to the tyranny of the towel, he did not surrender entirely.
A friend is someone who will alert you that you have missed a spot on your nose before your mother
sees it, saving you the indignity of being sent back to the basin.

23. The Envy of the Tramp Respectable society looks down on the town drunk or the wandering tramp, but to a
boy, these men are royalty. They have achieved the ultimate dream: they answer to no one. They do not have
to go to school, they sleep in barns, and they wear clothes that are already ruined, so they cannot get
into trouble for ruining them further. A boy will watch a tramp eating a stolen turnip by the railroad tracks
with a burning jealousy. He reckons that if he could just get out from under the thumb of his parents,
he too could lead such a glorious life of leisure. The tramp is the only free man in a world
of slaves.

24. The Alchemy of Trash If you give a man a brass doorknob, he sees a piece of scrap metal. If
you give a boy a brass doorknob, he sees a nugget of pirate gold, or the control lever of a
steam engine, or a weapon to slay a giant. The imagination of a boy is a philosopher's stone that turns
rubbish into riches. Friends will spend an entire afternoon digging in a heap of refuse, pulling out broken gears and
glass bottles with the excitement of miners striking a vein. They will fight over a rusted spur that hasn't seen
a horse in fifty years. To the boy, the value of an object is not what it costs, but what
it can be pretended to be.

25. The Tragedy of Autumn There is a dark day that comes every year, usually in October, which marks the end
of freedom: the day the shoes must be put back on. For the long, glorious summer, the foot has been
naked, spreading wide and growing tough as leather. The sole could walk on gravel without a flinch. Then comes the
frost, and the foot is crammed back into the shoe. It is a confinement as cruel as a jail cell.
The boy walks with a limp for a week, feeling the leather bite into his heel, mourning the loss of
his connection to the earth. He looks at his friends, all equally hobbled, and they share a silent grief for
the passing of the season of liberty.

26. The Art of the Insult Conversation between friends is not a polite exchange of ideas; it is a sparring match.
Boys test their affection by seeing how close they can come to insulting each other without actually starting a war.
One will remark on the size of the other's ears; the other will comment on the questionable intelligence of the
first one's dog. This banter is a shield. It allows them to be close without the embarrassment of being sentimental.
If a boy praises you, he likely wants to borrow your knife. If he tells you that you look like
a scarecrow that lost its stuffing, he is your brother for life.

27. The Piano Lesson There is no sound more mournful than the practicing of scales on a sunny afternoon. It is
the sound of a boy being broken on the wheel of culture. While the birds are singing and the fish
are biting, he is trapped on a stool, forcing his fingers to stumble over the ivory keys. He plays with
the heavy hand of a blacksmith. He hates the music, he hates the composer, and most of all, he hates
the metronome. His friends outside hear the plinking and know he is lost to them for the hour. They might
throw a pebble at the window, not to torment him, but to let him know that the living world is
still waiting for him when his sentence is served.

28. The Miracle Recovery It is a medical marvel how the health of a boy fluctuates with the days of the
week. On a Tuesday morning, when the geography lesson looms, he is at death's door. He has a cough, a
stomach ache, and a mysterious limp. He groans with the weight of the world. But let the clock strike ten
on a Saturday, and the cripple is suddenly healed. He can run faster, jump higher, and yell louder than any
creature on two legs. Parents view this recovery with suspicion, but the boy knows it is simply the curative power
of liberty. The schoolhouse is a breeding ground for ailments; the woods are the fountain of youth.

29. The Heroism of the Scar A boy without a scar is like a soldier without a medal; he has no
history. A cut on the finger from a whittling accident or a scrape on the knee from a fall is
not a source of pain, but of prestige. It is a story to be told and retold. Friends will gather
around to inspect the wound, debating whether it will require stitches or leave a permanent mark. If it leaves a
mark, the boy is elevated in the hierarchy. He carries the proof of his adventures on his skin. A boy
who goes through childhood with his skin intact has clearly played it too safe.

30. The Secret Society Two boys cannot simply be friends; they must be a Gang. They require a secret name, a
secret handshake, and a password that changes daily. They meet in a cave or a hollowed-out bush and discuss plans
to rob a stagecoach (which usually amounts to stealing a pie from a windowsill). The purpose of the society is
not crime, but exclusion. The joy comes from knowing something that the rest of the world—especially the adults and the
girls—does not know. They whisper in corners, looking important. It is the beginning of politics, and the beginning of the
understanding that the world is divided into "Us" and "Them."

31. The Hypocrisy of Giants Adults are a puzzle that no boy can solve. They spend all day telling a boy
that lying is a sin that leads straight to the fiery furnace. Yet, let the parson come to dinner, and
the mother will smile and say the chicken is tender when it is tough as a boot heel, and the
father will say he is delighted to see the visitor when he was just complaining about the intrusion five minutes
prior. A boy watches this with a confused heart. He reckons that the truth is a flexible thing, intended only
for children to use when they have broken a window, but optional for grown-ups when they want to be polite.
It teaches him that morality is largely a matter of size.

32. The Gauntlet of the Stairs Daylight is the time for bravery, but the dark is the time for repentance. When
a boy is sent to bed, he must ascend the stairs, which have suddenly transformed into a passage of horrors.
Every shadow in the corner is a crouching beast; the creak of the floorboard is a ghost's footstep. He walks
with a studied slowness to show he is not afraid, but the moment he turns the corner, he bolts for
his room like a rabbit. He dives under the quilt, which is the only material known to man that is
proof against demons. A friend who stays the night is a comfort, not because he can fight the ghosts, but
because the ghost might eat him first, giving you time to escape.

33. The Sunday School Commerce The ambition of a Sunday School student is not to learn the verses, but to acquire
the tickets. A blue ticket is worth two verses; a red ticket is worth ten blue ones. If a boy
saves enough, he gets a Dore Bible worth forty cents. No boy actually wants the Bible—it is full of words
and has no pictures of pirates—but he wants the glory of winning it. So, a brisk trade develops. A boy
with capital (a fast top or a dead bat) can buy up tickets from the poor scholars. He marches up
to the pulpit to claim his prize, a fraudulent scholar who couldn't recite the Ten Commandments to save his life,
but who understands the principles of banking perfectly.

34. The Experiment with Tobacco There comes a day when a group of friends decides that they are now men and
must prove it by smoking. They procure an old corn-cob pipe or perhaps roll some grapevines in paper. They retreat
to the woods, sitting in a solemn circle, puffing away and telling each other how fine it tastes. In truth,
it tastes like burning leaves and despair. Soon, the conversation dies. One boy turns a pale shade of green; another
suddenly remembers he has urgent business at home. They part ways with dignity, only to spend the next hour lying
under separate trees, praying for death. They never speak of it again, but they look at their fathers' pipes with
a new and nauseated respect.

35. The Barbarism of the Loose Tooth A loose tooth is a source of celebrity for a day and terror for
an evening. In school, the boy with the wobbler is a king; he can wiggle it for an audience, charging
a marble for a look. But at home, the parents view it as a construction project. They do not believe
in waiting for nature. They produce a length of strong thread. One end goes to the tooth, the other to
the doorknob. The horror of the setup is absolute. They tell him it won't hurt, which is the oldest lie
in history. When the deed is done, the boy is left with a gap that his tongue can't leave alone
and a bloody trophy to keep in a box—a gruesome reminder of the price of growing up.

36. The Intrusion of the Dog in Church A church service is designed to be as dull as possible to test
the soul's endurance. But Providence sometimes sends a mercy in the form of a stray dog. The dog wanders down
the aisle, tail wagging, sniffing at the boots of the elders. The boys in the back pew hold their breath,
eyes dancing with joy. They know what is coming. The dog will inevitably find a beetle, or perhaps engage in
a noisy battle with a flea, right in the middle of the silent prayer. The beadle will try to catch
him, resulting in a low-speed chase that is better than any circus. For one glorious moment, the sacred air is
punctured by the ridiculous, and the boys have to bite their cheeks to keep from exploding.

37. The Conscience of the Thunderstorm A boy’s conscience is a dormant creature that sleeps soundly while he is stealing apples
or tying a tin can to a tail. But let a summer storm roll in, with thunder that shakes the
house, and the conscience wakes up in a panic. He immediately assumes the lightning is looking for him. He reviews
his recent crimes and finds them numerous. He promises the ceiling that if he survives this night, he will never
sin again; he will lead a blameless life, wash his ears without prompting, and be kind to his sister. The
storm passes, the sun comes out, and the resolve melts away with the puddles. He reckons the danger is over,
and his virtue can wait for the next cloud.

38. The Tell-Tale Collar The forbidden swim is the crown jewel of summer. The boys strip off their clothes and dive
into the muddy river, washing away the heat and the rules. But the return home is fraught with peril. A
mother has eyes like a hawk. If the shirt is buttoned wrong, or the hair is too wet, the game
is up. A smart boy knows to sew his shirt collar with black thread so he can break the seal
and re-sew it. But a mother, with diabolical cunning, will switch the thread to white while he sleeps. He comes
home confident, only to be betrayed by his own sewing kit. There is no escaping the forensic genius of a
suspicious parent.

39. The Misery of the Model Child Occasionally, a rich family moves to town, bringing with them a boy who wears
velvet, owns real boots instead of shoes, and has a handkerchief that isn't a rag. The town boys circle him
like wolves. They envy his possessions but despise his manners. He speaks with proper grammar, which is an offense to
the ear. If he is generous with his toys, he may be tolerated as a curiosity. If he is haughty,
he is doomed. He will be challenged to fight, and when he refuses (because he has been taught that fighting
is low), he will be branded a coward. He is the loneliest creature on earth—too rich for the boys, too
young for the men.

40. The Exhaustion of Doing Nothing Adults think that because a boy has no job, he is not tired. They do
not understand the sheer physical exertion required to be a boy. To climb three oak trees, dam a creek, run
from a farmer, dig a hole to China (and give up at three feet), and fight a war against invisible
Indians—this is a full day's labor. By supper time, a boy is not just tired; he is boneless. He sits
at the table with dirt in his creases and his eyes rolling back in his head. He falls asleep with
his boots on, utterly spent by the serious business of wasting time.

41. The Horror of the Elocution Once a year, the schoolmaster decides that the parents must see what they are paying
for, and so he organizes an Exhibition. This is a night of suffering for all involved. A boy is forced
onto a stage, his hair plastered down with grease, to recite a poem about a dying flower or a noble
general. He stands there, knees knocking together like castanets, and immediately forgets his own name. He stammers, he sweats, he
looks at his shoes. In the front row, his friend is making terrible faces at him, trying to make him
laugh and ruin the whole affair. To the audience, it is a recitation; to the boy, it is a public
hanging without the benefit of a blindfold.

42. The Tyranny of Castor Oil There is no logic in the adult mind when it comes to sickness. If a
boy has a fever, they pile blankets on him; if he is cold, they open a window. But for all
ailments, from a stomach ache to a broken heart, the remedy is the same: Castor Oil. It is a yellow,
greasy liquid that tastes like regret. The spoon approaches the mouth like an executioner’s axe. The boy pleads, he bargains,
he offers to confess to crimes he didn't commit just to escape the dose. But the mother is iron. She
holds the nose and pours. The friendship of a boy is tested here; if he laughs at your suffering, he
is a traitor. If he offers you a peppermint to kill the taste, he is a saint.

43. The Moral Problem of the Watermelon Stealing a watermelon is not a sin; it is a horticultural adjustment. A boy
reasons that a melon growing in a field is lonely and wishes to fulfill its destiny. However, getting it over
the fence without dropping it requires the coordination of a military campaign. If the farmer has a dog, the stakes
are raised to life and death. The true moral crisis comes when they crack it open and find it is
green and unripe. Do they admit they were wrong? Never. They eat the sour, hard fruit with grim determination, praising
its sweetness with tears in their eyes, because to admit the theft was for nothing would be a humiliation too
great to bear.

44. The Betrayal of the Haircut A boy’s hair is his own business, or at least it ought to be. He
prefers it long, matted, and capable of housing small wildlife. But the mother views this as a personal failing. She
sits him on a stool, ties a sheet around his neck, and attacks him with shears. She cuts by the
bowl method, which leaves him looking like a mushroom with ears. The tragedy is not the loss of hair, but
the reception at school the next day. A fresh haircut is a signal for every other boy to rub the
back of the victim's neck—"for luck," they say, but really for the sheer joy of friction. He walks through the
playground protecting his head like a man in a hailstorm.

45. The Accidental Engagement It happens by accident. A boy is sharing a slate with a girl, or perhaps he gives
her a particularly fine brass knob from a drawer. Suddenly, she whispers that they are "engaged." He nods, thinking this
means he gets to walk her home. He does not realize he has signed away his freedom. Suddenly, she demands
to know why he was playing with other boys instead of sitting with her. She wants to know why his
hands are dirty. The noose tightens. He realizes with a cold dread that he is now expected to be civilized.
He usually gets out of it by feigning a contagious disease or simply running away into the woods until she
forgets his name.

46. The Sorrow of the Lost Marble A boy can lose a hat or a coat and feel nothing but relief.
But let him lose his favorite "taw"—the agate shooter that has won him a fortune—and his world collapses. He will
search the grass on his hands and knees for hours, praying to St. Anthony. He feels the loss physically, a
hole in his pocket and his soul. His friends will help him search, but their sympathy is limited; they are
secretly calculating their chances of winning his second-best marble now that the champion is gone. It is a lesson in
the cruelty of fate: the things we love most are the roundest and the most likely to roll down a
drain.

47. The Echo Chamber There is a specific joy in finding a hollow under a bridge or a canyon wall that
talks back. Boys will stand there for an hour shouting "Hello!" and "You're a fool!" just to hear the world
agree with them. It is the only conversation they can have where they are guaranteed to get the last word.
They will test the echo with bad words, whispered softly, to see if the rocks will tattle. If the echo
is loud enough, they feel a sense of power, as if they have multiplied themselves. It is a simple magic,
free of charge, and it beats a geography lesson any day of the week.

48. The Rich Aunt's Gift Every family has a distant aunt who lives in the city and has no understanding of
human nature. At Christmas, she sends a package. The boy opens it with trembling hands, hoping for a knife, a
pistol, or even a firecracker. Instead, he pulls out... a book. And not a book about Indians, but a book
about "Etiquette" or "The Boy Who Was Kind to Cats." Or worse, socks. He has to write a letter of
thanks, which is the finest piece of fiction he will ever compose, telling her that the socks are just what
he "needed." He learns early that gratitude is often just a polite form of lying.

49. The Logic of the Half-Ticket On the train or the ferry, the conductor asks the age of the boy. The
father says, "He is under twelve," and pays the half-fare. The boy, who was twelve last month and is currently
chewing tobacco, shrinks down in his seat and tries to look infantile. He wears a face of innocent stupidity. He
knows he is participating in a fraud, but he also knows that the saved money might buy peanuts. It is
a confusing lesson: honesty is the best policy, unless there is a fare involved, in which case you are as
young as you can get away with. He wonders if the conductor knows, and reckons that the conductor was once
a boy too.

50. The Doom of Sunday Evening The sun sets on Sunday with a different quality of light—a heavy, gray conviction. The
freedom of the weekend is bleeding out. The school clothes are laid out on the chair like a shroud. The
homework that was ignored on Friday and Saturday now sits on the table, a pile of accusations. The boy sits
on the porch, watching the fireflies, feeling the impending doom of Monday. He bargains with God, offering to be a
missionary in Africa if only the schoolhouse would burn down during the night. It never does. The clock ticks on,
indifferent to his misery, marching him steadily toward the multiplication tables.

Here is the final batch (51–65) of paragraphs on "Childhood and Friendship," completing the collection with the final observations on
the small savage.

Batch 6: The Final Reckoning of Youth 51. The Dog in the Bed A mother believes that a dog is
a dirty animal that belongs in the barn. A boy believes that a dog is a heated blanket provided by
nature. The conflict arises nightly. The boy smuggles the dog up the back stairs, holding its snout shut to prevent
a bark. Once under the quilt, the dog curls into the boy’s back, smelling of wet earth and loyalty. It
is the most comfortable sleep known to man. If the mother comes in, the boy pretends to snore, and the
dog holds its breath. They are co-conspirators against the tyranny of hygiene.

52. The Amateur Circus Every group of friends eventually decides they can run a circus better than Mr. Barnum. They charge
a fee of three pins or a glass marble. The "lion" is a yellow dog with a mane made of
old mop strings, looking thoroughly humiliated. The "acrobat" is a boy who can jump off the woodshed roof without breaking
a leg, though he usually bruises a heel. The audience, consisting of four smaller boys and a confused toddler, watches
with skepticism. The show always ends in disaster—the lion bites the acrobat, or the tent collapses—but for one hour, they
are showmen of the highest order.

53. The Injustice of Bedtime The sun is still high in the sky, the birds are singing, and the world is
full of light. Yet, the clock says it is seven, and the law says it is bedtime. It is a
crime against nature. The boy lies in his bed, listening to the older people laughing on the porch, feeling the
injustice burn in his chest. He reckons that parents invented bedtime not for the health of the child, but simply
to get rid of him so they could eat the good cake. He stares at the ceiling, plotting a future
where he stays up until dawn eating nothing but pie.

54. The Rich Kid's Toy When the banker’s son brings out a new mechanical toy—a train that winds up or a
soldier that marches—the other boys gather around in a circle of reverence. They do not touch it; they only watch.
But soon, the itch sets in. They convince the owner that the toy would work better if it were taken
apart to see the engine. With the precision of surgeons, they dismantle the expensive gift. When they cannot put it
back together, and the spring flies out into the grass, they feel a secret satisfaction. They have reduced the rich
boy to their level. A broken toy is a tragedy for him, but a triumph for the democracy of the
dirt.

55. The Theology of Fishing A boy prays for many things—a new knife, a blizzard to close the school—but he prays
hardest when the bobber goes under. He makes rash promises to the Almighty. "Lord, let this be a catfish, and
I will wash the dishes for a month." It is a transactional faith. If the line snaps, he figures the
Lord was busy or simply preferred the fish. If he lands it, he accepts the miracle as his due reward.
He rarely follows through on the dishes, figuring that Providence has a short memory and more important things to worry
about than a boy’s chores.

56. The Noble Art of Spitting There is spitting, which is a necessity, and then there is Spitting, which is an
art form. A boy who can hit a knot-hole in a fence from ten feet away commands respect. It requires
a specific configuration of the teeth and a tongue maneuver that takes years to master. Friends will practice for hours,
dehydrating themselves in the pursuit of accuracy. A gap in the front teeth is considered a natural advantage, a gift
from fortune. To spit cleanly and with force is a sign of manhood; to dribble on one's own chin is
a social disgrace that can last a season.

57. The Unwanted Kiss The arrival of a female relative signals the approach of the dreaded greeting. She swoops down with
a scent of lavender and old lace, aiming for the cheek. The boy stands rigid, holding his breath, enduring the
wet smack like a soldier facing a firing squad. He wipes it off the instant she turns away, rubbing the
spot until it is raw. His friends watch from a safe distance, snickering. They know that to be kissed in
public is to be branded a baby. He glares at them, daring them to say a word, his honor hanging
by a thread.

58. The Forbidden Fruit A green apple is hard, sour, and likely to cause a stomach ache that feels like a
badger fighting in your gut. Yet, it is irresistible because it is stolen. The boys climb the farmer’s wall, fill
their shirts with the rock-hard fruit, and run like deer. They eat them in the woods, faces puckering at the
acid taste. They tell each other it is delicious. Later, when they are doubled over in agony, they do not
regret the theft; they only regret the constitution of the stomach. The pain is the receipt for the adventure.

59. The Spectacle of the Drunkard When the town drunkard stumbles into the street, singing a song that has no tune,
the boys stop their play. They follow him at a safe distance, fascinated. He is a one-man parade. He argues
with a lamp post; he bows to a stray cat. The boys mimic his walk, staggering and weaving. It is
cruel, but it is also a study in human nature. They wonder what makes a man want to lose his
legs and his wits. They laugh, but deep down, there is a small fear—a glimpse of a world where grown-ups
lose control and become more foolish than children.

60. The Secret Language English is good enough for school, but it is too open for secrets. Friends invent a language—Pig
Latin, or a gibberish of "Op" and "Iz"—to baffle the enemy. They sit at the dinner table asking for the
"s-op-alt" and "b-op-utter," delighting in the confusion of their parents. It gives them a sense of superiority. They are members
of a tribe with its own tongue. If a parent cracks the code, they simply invent a new one, adding
more syllables until the conversation sounds like a turkey choking. It is the joy of being understood by the few
and misunderstood by the many.

61. The Cat and the Painkiller When a boy is forced to take medicine he doesn't need, his first instinct is
to share it. The family cat, usually a creature of dignity, becomes the victim. The boy pries open the jaw
and pours in the fire-liquid. The cat goes up the curtains, knocks over a vase, and exits through a closed
window. The boy laughs until he cries. When the mother asks what happened, he says the cat "had a fit."
He reckons he has done the cat a favor, giving it a taste of the excitement that he is denied.
It is a scientific experiment on the effects of stimulation on the feline nervous system.

62. The Infinite Summer June is not a month; it is a lifetime. When school lets out, the expanse of time
stretching before a boy seems endless. He can build a raft, learn to whistle, and dig a cave, and still
have time to spare. The days are long and hot, filled with the drone of insects and the smell of
dust. He forgets what 9 times 7 is. He forgets the shape of a shoe. He becomes a creature of
the sun. The idea that September exists is a rumor he refuses to believe. He lives in the eternal Now,
where the only clock is the rumble of his stomach.

63. The Ruined Trousers There is no fabric woven by the loom of man that can withstand the knees of a
boy. He does not walk; he slides, crawls, and climbs. A new pair of trousers is a challenge. How quickly
can they be stained with grass? How fast can a hole appear? When the inevitable tear happens—usually while climbing a
fence to retrieve a ball—he tries to pin it shut or cover it with his hand. He walks sideways to
hide the damage. He knows that holes in the cloth are really holes in his character, at least in his
mother's eyes.

64. The Swear Word He hears it from a teamster driving a mule. It is a short, sharp word, full of
power. He carries it home like a loaded gun. He whispers it to himself in the woods, feeling the thrill
of the taboo. He waits for the perfect moment—perhaps when he stubs his toe or drops his marble. He lets
it fly. The world stops. The air seems to crackle. If he is caught, the taste of soap will be
his penance. If he gets away with it, he feels two inches taller. He has spoken the language of men.

65. The End of the Era One day, the boy looks in the mirror and sees a stranger. The voice cracks
and squeaks like a rusty hinge. The games of pirates and Indians seem suddenly foolish. He puts on his first
pair of long trousers, covering the scarred knees of his youth. He walks past the swimming hole and does not
stop. He tips his hat to a girl and does not run away. His friends drift apart, bound for jobs
and sweethearts. He has entered the foreign country of adulthood. He puts his marbles in a box and shuts the
lid, not knowing he is closing the book on the happiest chapter of his life.
