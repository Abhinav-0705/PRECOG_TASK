1. The Diagnosis of Calf-Love There is a specific season in a boy’s life, usually arriving just after the mumps, when
he loses his mind. The symptoms are unmistakable. He stops eating with his usual ferocity; he begins to wash behind
his ears without a court order; and he is found staring at the moon with the expression of a dying
calf. This affliction is known as "Love." To the adult eye, the object of his affection is merely a girl
with a missing tooth and a penchant for giggling. But to the boy, she is an angel made of light
and calico. He discovers that he is suddenly clumsy, stumbling over his own feet whenever she appears. It is a
terrible fever, and the only mercy is that it rarely lasts longer than a week.

2. The Currency of Affection In the world of the schoolhouse, love is a transaction of property. A boy does not
declare his devotion with sonnets, for he knows no words that rhyme with "beautiful" except "dutiful," and that sounds like
a chore. Instead, he offers tribute. A brass doorknob, polished on a sleeve until it blinds the eye, is a
declaration of eternal passion. A half-eaten apple, passed secretly under the desk, is a proposal of marriage. If the girl
accepts the apple and takes a bite, the pact is sealed. It is a simpler time, when a heart can
be won for the low price of a dead beetle or a piece of chewing gum that has lost its
flavor.

3. The Gymnastic Courtship When a boy wishes to impress a girl, his instinct is not to speak to her—speech is
dangerous and liable to failure—but to risk his neck in her vicinity. He waits until she is watching, and then
he engages in a series of violent acrobatics. He hangs by his knees from the highest branch of the oak
tree; he walks the top rail of the fence; he stands on his head until his face turns purple. He
is saying, in the silent language of the male, "Behold, I am durable and foolish, which are the two chief
requirements for a husband." Usually, she is looking at her slate, and he bruises his shin for nothing, which is
the first hard lesson of romance.

4. The Rivalry of the New Boy The course of true love never runs smooth, especially when a New Boy moves
to town. This interloper usually possesses some unfair advantage: a velvet jacket, perhaps, or the ability to whistle through his
teeth. The local boy watches with burning jealousy as his intended gives the stranger a shy smile. The hatred he
feels is pure and biblical. He imagines various dooms for the rival—falling into a well, or being carried off by
Indians. He challenges the new boy to a fight, not over the girl (that would be unmanly), but over some
fabricated insult regarding a dog. It is a duel for honor, where the prize is a ribbon and the cost
is a bloody nose.

5. The Agony of the Valentine February brings a plague upon the schoolroom. The obligation to create a Valentine is a
burden that weighs heavily on the soul. The boy sits with a piece of red paper and a pair of
scissors, sweating. He tries to cut a heart, but it usually comes out looking like a kidney. Then comes the
poetry. He chews his pencil. "Roses are red, violets are blue..." is safe, but he feels it lacks fire. He
tries to compose something original about her eyes, but realizes he doesn't know what color they are. He finally settles
for "You are nice," and signs it with a question mark, terrified of rejection but hopeful for a miracle.

6. The Sunday School Stare Church is the primary theater for silent courtship. The boys sit on the left, the girls
on the right, separated by the aisle and the vigilance of the parson. This separation only intensifies the drama. The
boy spends the entire sermon twisting his neck to catch a glimpse of a bonnet. If she turns and catches
his eye, he blushes so hot he fears his collar will ignite. They communicate in a code of blinks and
grimaces. The sermon on the fiery furnace holds no terror for him; his own personal fire is burning right there
in the third pew, wearing a blue sash.

7. The Terror of the Father Every angel has a guardian dragon, and in this case, it is the Father. He
sits on the front porch in the evening, smoking a pipe, looking like a fortress that cannot be breached. The
boy who wishes to call on the daughter must run the gauntlet. He walks up the path, his boots sounding
like thunder on the gravel. He takes off his hat. He stammers a greeting. The Father looks at him over
the newspaper with a gaze that measures his worth and finds it lacking. To the boy, this man is not
a potential in-law; he is the Judge of the Earth, and he knows about the stolen watermelon.

8. The Accidental Engagement Children are mimics, and they play at being adults with a solemnity that is laughable. A boy
and a girl, finding themselves alone behind the schoolhouse, will suddenly decide to be "engaged." It is a spontaneous treaty.
He says, "I love you," because he has heard it in a play. She says, "I love you too," because
it seems the polite response. They sit there, terrified, wondering what happens next. They kiss, which turns out to be
wet and confusing. Then the bell rings, and they run back to class, relieved to be children again, secretly hoping
the engagement doesn't interfere with the game of tag at recess.

9. The Serenade of the Cat Romantic literature suggests that playing music beneath a lady’s window is the height of gallantry.
In practice, it is a nuisance. The boy arrives with a banjo or a fiddle, or simply a strong pair
of lungs. He stands in the damp grass, battling mosquitoes. He begins to sing "The Last Rose of Summer." The
result is not enchantment. The neighborhood dogs join in; a window slams shut; a boot is thrown. He learns that
the acoustics of the night are cruel, and that true love is less likely to be rewarded with a rose
than with a bucket of water.

10. The Fickleness of Fate The tragedy of childhood romance is its brevity. On Tuesday, a boy is ready to die
for a girl with yellow braids. He carves her initials into a tree. He cannot eat. He is a poet
of sorrow. By Friday, he has met a girl with brown curls who has a pony. The yellow braids are
forgotten as if they never existed. The initials on the tree remain, a monument to a passion that lasted three
days. The boy does not feel guilty; he feels that he has lived a lifetime. The heart is a resilient
muscle, capable of breaking and healing a dozen times before long trousers are even worn.

11. The Misunderstanding of the Flower A boy reads in a book that ladies appreciate flowers. He determines to procure some.
He raids his mother’s garden, selecting the largest, brightest blooms—usually the prize dahlias she was saving for the county fair.
He presents this bouquet to his beloved, thrusting it at her like a weapon. The girl accepts it with a
giggle. But the boy’s triumph is short-lived. He returns home to find his mother standing over the ruined garden bed
with the wrath of a storm goddess. He learns that love requires sacrifice, but that the sacrifice is usually his
own backside when the switch comes out. He decides that next time, a dead frog is a safer gift.

12. The Jealousy of the Pet When a boy falls in love, his dog knows it instantly and takes offense. The
dog, previously the sole recipient of the boy’s affection, watches with a jaundiced eye as the boy combs his hair
and ties a ribbon. When the boy leaves to walk the girl home, the dog follows at a sullen distance.
If the boy pats the girl’s hand, the dog barks a sharp warning. He is the guardian of the boy’s
dignity. He knows that this girl is a temporary madness, whereas a dog is a permanent condition. He waits on
the porch, confident that when the romance fails, the boy will return to the true faith of chasing rabbits.

13. The Mystery of the Hair Ribbon To a boy, the female wardrobe is a cipher. He cannot distinguish silk from
calico. But he learns to recognize the significance of the Hair Ribbon. If she wears a red ribbon, she is
angry; if blue, she is sad; if pink, she is approachable. He studies these signals like a sailor watching the
sky. He panics when she wears green, for which he has no data. He spends the morning in agony, wondering
if green means "I love you" or "Go away." He eventually asks her, and she laughs, telling him she just
liked the color. He feels the fool, realizing that girls do not operate by the rigid semaphore of boyhood.

14. The Tragedy of the Shared Hymnal In church, the highest intimacy allowed by law is the sharing of a hymnal.
If a boy manages to sit next to his sweetheart, he offers to hold one side of the book. His
hand touches hers—an electric shock that nearly knocks him off the pew. They sing "Rock of Ages," but he hears
nothing. He is conscious only of the scent of lavender and the warmth of her shoulder. He sings the wrong
verse. He sings loudly to cover his confusion. The congregation turns to stare. He wishes the floor would open up,
but he refuses to let go of the book. It is his anchor in a storm of embarrassment.

15. The Love Letter in the Knot-Hole Since direct speech is impossible, the knot-hole in the schoolyard fence becomes the post
office of romance. The boy writes a note on a scrap of slate paper: "Do you like me? Yes or
No." He deposits it in the tree and waits. The suspense is worse than a toothache. He checks the hole
every hour. Finally, a reply appears. He unfolds it with trembling hands. It says: "You smell like a horse." The
devastation is total. He tears the note into confetti and swears off women forever. He devotes himself to the study
of pirates, who, he reasons, never have to deal with rejection slips.

16. The Showing-Off Disaster The desire to impress a female is the root of all broken bones. A boy sees his
beloved watching from a porch. He is riding a horse. He decides to make the horse gallop. He kicks the
beast. The horse, surprised, stops abruptly. The boy continues forward, describing a perfect arc through the air and landing in
a mud puddle. He sits there, dripping, while the girl covers her mouth to hide a smile. His dignity is
shattered. He limps away, leading the horse, understanding too late that the most impressive thing a man can do is
stay in the saddle.

17. The Pain of the Party A party is a trap designed by mothers to force boys to be social. The
boy stands in the corner, clutching his cap, terrified. The girls are on the other side of the room, giggling
in a terrifying phalanx. He is ordered to ask a girl to dance. He would rather walk through fire. He
marches across the floor like a soldier going to his execution. He bows to a girl he has known all
his life but who now looks like a stranger in her lace. They shuffle around the floor, stepping on each
other's feet, silent as stones. When the music stops, they part with the relief of prisoners released from chains.

18. The Betrayal of the Friend A boy confides in his best friend that he has a "soft spot" for the
baker’s daughter. He extracts a blood oath of secrecy. The next day, the entire town knows. The friend has sold
the secret for a laugh. The boy walks down the street, and people smile at him. The baker winks. The
girl blushes and runs away. The boy burns with shame. He realizes that a secret told to another human being
is like a feather thrown in the wind—you can never get it back. He plots a terrible revenge on his
friend, involving a snake and a sleeping bag, to restore his honor.

19. The Older Woman Every boy eventually falls in love with a woman who is impossibly old—usually the schoolteacher, who is
at least twenty. She is a goddess. She smells of chalk and roses. He stays after school to clap the
erasers, choking on dust just to be near her. He brings her apples. He dreams of rescuing her from a
burning building. Then, tragedy strikes. A man with a mustache comes to the school—a suitor. The boy watches them walk
away together. His heart breaks. He realizes the cruel math of age: he will never catch up to her. He
accepts his fate with tragic nobility, deciding to love her from afar, like a monk.

20. The End of the Affair Most childhood romances end not with a bang, but with a distraction. The boy and
girl have sworn eternal love on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the circus comes to town. The boy forgets the girl. The
girl forgets the boy. They meet a week later and look at each other with vague recognition. The passion has
evaporated. They do not mourn; they simply move on. The boy goes back to his marbles; the girl goes back
to her dolls. Adults marvel at this fickleness, forgetting that to a child, a week is a year, and the
heart is a slate that can be wiped clean with a single swipe of the sponge.

21. The Carving of the Desk A school desk is not merely furniture; it is a register of deeds and a
monument to passion. A boy, overcome by the beauty of a girl three rows ahead, feels compelled to immortality. He
takes his jackknife and carves her initials deep into the wood of his desk. It is a slow, laborious process
that ruins the blade. He fills the grooves with ink to make them stand out. He believes he is erecting
a Taj Mahal. In reality, he is defacing government property to celebrate a love that will likely expire before the
ink is dry. The desk, however, remains—a scarred witness to the fact that Sarah Miller was once the queen of
the world.

22. The Strategic Snub The logic of love is inverted in the young mind. If a boy despises a girl, he
ignores her. But if he adores her, he treats her with a studied indifference that borders on cruelty. He sees
her coming down the street and immediately becomes fascinated by a dead beetle in the dirt. He refuses to look
at her. He speaks loudly to his friends about how much he hates girls. He hopes she interprets this cold
shoulder as a sign of his burning devotion. Remarkably, she often does, understanding that in the lexicon of the playground,
a snub is just a hug turned inside out.

23. The Heroic Daydream A boy does not dream of holding hands; that is too tame. He dreams of catastrophe. He
sits in arithmetic class, not listening to the lesson, but constructing a scenario where the schoolhouse catches fire. He imagines
the panic, the screams. Then, he sees himself—cool, calm, and covered in soot—carrying his beloved out of the flames while
the other boys cower in fear. He lays her on the grass; she opens her eyes and whispers his name.
This fantasy is so vivid that when the teacher calls on him to answer "what is nine times seven," he
looks at her with the dazed expression of a man who has just saved a life and cannot be bothered
with trifles.

24. The Ring of Wire When the engagement is decided upon, a ring is required. Gold is out of the question,
being the province of bankers and kings. The boy resorts to ingenuity. He fashions a ring out of a twisted
horseshoe nail, or perhaps the red band from a cigar. He presents it with the solemnity of a coronation. The
girl accepts it, squeezing it onto her finger where it turns the skin green. She displays it to her friends
as if it were a diamond of the first water. It is a symbol of a bond that is iron-clad,
at least until the metal rusts or the boy needs the nail back to fix a fishing rod.

25. The Torture of the Dancing School There is no invention of the devil quite as effective as the Dancing School.
A mother decides her son must have "graces," and he is marched to a hall to learn the waltz. He
wears gloves that feel like boxing mitts. He is paired with a girl who is a head taller than him.
He places a sweating hand on her waist, terrified he will crush her sash. They move in a grim square,
counting steps under their breath. He looks at his friends, all equally miserable, and they exchange glances of silent commiseration.
They are soldiers in a war against their own feet, fighting for a dignity they lost the moment the fiddle
started.

26. The Oracle of the Daisy When certainty is required, a boy turns to botany. He picks a daisy and begins
the ritual: "She loves me, she loves me not." He plucks the petals with grim determination. He watches the pile
grow. If the flower threatens to end on "She loves me not," he acts quickly. He either discards the last
petal as "defective" or simply pulls two at once. He is not above rigging the election of fate. He believes
the flower speaks the truth, provided the flower is properly managed. If the result is favorable, he puts the stem
in his buttonhole; if not, he crushes the lying weed into the dirt.

27. The Walk Home The journey from the schoolhouse to the girl’s gate is the longest mile in geography. The boy
offers to carry her books. She accepts. They walk side by side, separated by two feet of air that feels
like a canyon. He searches his mind for conversation. He thinks of mentioning his dog, but decides against it. He
thinks of the weather, but it seems too dull. So they walk in silence, kicking at stones. The silence stretches
until it hums. When they reach her gate, he hands back the books, sweating. She says "Goodbye," and he runs
home, exhausted by the mental exertion of saying absolutely nothing for twenty minutes.

28. The Pomade Disaster A boy decides that his natural hair—which resembles a haystack in a gale—is insufficient for romance. He
raids his father’s supply of hair oil or, failing that, the kitchen lard. He plasters his hair down until it
is a shiny, hard helmet. He smells faintly of bear grease and optimism. He enters the schoolroom feeling like a
cavalier. But as the day warms up, the grease begins to melt. It trickles down his forehead. He attracts flies.
The girl looks at him with alarm. He realizes too late that while a smooth appearance is desirable, a melting
head is not the way to a lady’s heart.

29. The Rival from the City The local boy can compete with his peers—he can spit further and run faster. But
he is helpless against the Cousin from the City. This rival arrives in the summer, wearing a suit with matching
trousers and a watch chain. He speaks of theaters and omnibuses. The girl listens to him, entranced. The local boy
stands at the edge of the circle, hands in his pockets, feeling his own insignificance. He cannot fight the City
Boy; he is outgunned by civilization. He can only wait for the summer to end, when the peacock will leave,
and the girl will have to settle once again for a boy whose primary talent is catching catfish.

30. The Letter of Retraction A romance often ends with a formal document. The boy, having been slighted (she laughed when
he fell off a fence), decides to sever ties. He writes a note: "I take it all back. You are
not my girl anymore. P.S. Give me back my gum." He delivers it with the haughtiness of an ambassador declaring
war. He expects her to weep. Instead, she reads it, shrugs, and goes back to jumping rope. He is crushed
by her indifference. He realizes that while he was living a tragedy, she was merely living a Tuesday. He walks
away, vowing to become a hermit, until he sees a new girl with a red ribbon, and the cycle begins
anew.

Here is the fourth batch (31–40) of paragraphs on "Love and Romance," continuing the chronicle of the affectionate absurdities.

Batch 4: Follies and Fickleness 31. The Picnic Strategy A boy views a picnic not as a meal, but as
a military campaign for affection. He maneuvers to sit near his beloved on the blanket. He offers her the choicest
pickle. He defends her from ants with the ferocity of a lion. He attempts to show his sophistication by eating
a hard-boiled egg in one bite, which results in a choking fit that turns his face a romantic shade of
purple. The girl thumps him on the back. He recovers, eyes watering, and smiles weakly. He has failed to be
debonair, but he has succeeded in gaining her pity, which he reckons is a close cousin to love anyway.

32. The Burden of the Locket If a boy is truly lost, he will give a girl a locket. It is
usually cheap tin, purchased with months of saved pennies. Inside, he places a lock of his hair, which he cut
himself with a dull knife, leaving a bald spot on his head. He presents it to her as if it
were the crown jewels. She wears it on a ribbon. To the boy, seeing that tin heart around her neck
is a triumph. It brands her. It tells the world that she carries a piece of him—quite literally—wherever she goes.
He walks taller, unaware that she takes it off the moment she gets home because it turns her neck green.

33. The Silent Serenade Since he cannot sing, and he plays no instrument, the boy invents the "Silent Serenade." He stands
across the street from her house at dusk, leaning against a tree in a posture of tragic melancholy. He hopes
she will look out the window and see him standing there, faithful and lonely. He stands until his legs cramp.
He stands until the mosquitoes have drained him of blood. Usually, no one looks out. Or worse, her father looks
out and yells at him to go home. He limps away, feeling that he has suffered for his art, even
if the audience never showed up.

34. The Terror of the Mistletoe Christmas brings many joys, but it also brings the Mistletoe, a parasitic plant that authorizes
public kissing. To a shy boy, a sprig of mistletoe hanging in a doorway is as dangerous as a guillotine.
He navigates the room with the caution of a ship in a minefield, avoiding the fatal spot. If he is
caught under it with a girl, the room erupts in cheers. He turns scarlet. He is expected to perform. He
pecks her cheek with the speed of a striking cobra and retreats to the safety of the punch bowl, vowing
to study botany so he can identify and destroy the weed before next year.

35. The Rivalry of the Uniform A boy in a plain shirt has no chance against a boy in a uniform.
Let a cadet from a military academy appear in town, with brass buttons and a stripe on his trousers, and
the local girls swoon in unison. The civilian boy watches this mass defection with bitterness. He tries to polish his
own buttons. He walks with a stiff leg to simulate a martial stride. It is useless. He learns the hard
lesson that the female heart is easily swayed by shiny metal and the promise of violence. He can only wait
for the cadet to leave, or for a war to start so he can get his own coat.

36. The Inscription in the Book When a boy gives a girl a book (usually a hymnal or a school reader),
he feels compelled to write a dedication on the flyleaf. He aims for poetry. He writes: "If you love me
as I love you, no knife can cut our love in two." He stares at it, admiring the rhyme. It
sounds dangerous and passionate. He draws a heart with an arrow through it, dripping blood. He feels this adds a
necessary gravity. The girl reads it and giggles. The boy is offended. He doesn't understand that threatening to cut love
with a knife is perhaps not the most romantic imagery, but he comforts himself that true genius is rarely appreciated
in its own time.

37. The Agony of the Church Social The Church Social is an event where ice cream is served with a side
of social anxiety. The boy buys two bowls—one for himself, one for her. He carries them through the crowd, navigating
skirts and elbows. The ice cream begins to melt. It runs down his fingers. He finally reaches her, only to
find her talking to his rival. He stands there, sticky and defeated. He cannot offer the soup that was once
ice cream. He retreats to a corner and eats both bowls himself, finding that gluttony is a cold but reliable
comfort for a broken heart.

38. The Token of the Tooth In the grim economy of boyhood, a loose tooth is a treasure. When it finally
comes out, the boy considers it a gift worthy of a queen. He wraps the bloody fang in a scrap
of paper and presents it to his sweetheart. "It's a premolar," he says proudly. The girl shrieks and drops it.
The boy is baffled. He thought she would appreciate the sacrifice, the sheer biological intimacy of the gift. He picks
up the tooth, dusts it off, and puts it back in his pocket. He decides that girls are too squeamish
for high romance and resolves to give it to his dog instead.

39. The Misinterpretation of the Smile A boy lives on crumbs. If a girl smiles at him, he builds a cathedral
on the foundation of that smile. He assumes it means she loves him. He assumes she wants to marry him.
He plans the house they will live in. He does not stop to consider that she might have been smiling
at a joke her friend told, or that she was simply displaying her new teeth. He floats through the day
in a delirium of happiness based entirely on a misunderstanding. When she ignores him the next day, the cathedral collapses,
leaving him in the ruins of his own imagination.

40. The Escape to the Woods When the pressure of romance becomes too great—when the jealousy, the valentines, and the hair
oil become a burden—the boy declares a retreat. He gathers his fishing pole and heads for the river. He meets
his friends there. They sit on the bank, dirty and happy. They talk of fish and frogs. They agree that
girls are a nuisance and that marriage is a trap. For an afternoon, they are free men. They bask in
the simple, uncomplicated love of a worm and a hook, knowing that the fever will return, but for now, the
fever has broken.

41. The Architecture of the Future When a boy proposes marriage—usually at recess, while eating a stolen apple—his vision of domestic
bliss is specific. He promises her a life of high adventure. He tells her they will live in a cave,
or perhaps on a raft that floats eternally down the Mississippi. They will eat nothing but cake and fish. He
expects her to be dazzled by this prospect of homelessness and scurvy. Instead, she asks if the cave has curtains.
She mentions a white picket fence. The boy is baffled. He realizes that while they both want to be together,
his version involves pirates and hers involves china plates, and the gap between them is wider than the river.

42. The Gastronomic Peril It is a hard law of nature that a boy cannot look romantic while eating corn on
the cob. If he finds himself at a supper where his beloved is present, the food becomes a trap. He
tries to eat with delicacy, but a healthy appetite is a savage thing. He attacks the corn; he greases his
chin; he makes a sound like a thumping machine. He looks up and catches her eye. She is nibbling a
biscuit like a bird. He feels like a hippopotamus at a tea party. He puts the corn down, defeated, deciding
that starvation is the only dignified option for a lover.

43. The Borrowed Finery In a desperate bid to look older, a boy will raid his father’s wardrobe. He appears at
the girl’s gate wearing a necktie that hangs to his knees and a hat that rests on his ears. He
believes he looks like a banker. In reality, he looks like a turtle shrinking into its shell. The clothes swamp
him; they emphasize exactly how small and unfinished he is. The girl suppresses a giggle. The boy mistakes her mirth
for admiration and struts, tripping over a pant leg. It is a masquerade that fools no one, least of all
the dog, who barks at him as if he were a stranger.

44. The Bond of Detention Adversity breeds romance. If a boy and a girl are both kept after school for whispering,
the punishment becomes a privilege. They sit at opposite ends of the room, the silence heavy with dust and chalk.
The teacher dozes at the desk. The boy looks at the girl; she looks at him. They are fellow prisoners
in the gulag of education. A silent sympathy passes between them. They are united against the tyranny of the alphabet.
When they are finally released into the sunlight, they walk home with the swagger of convicts who have done their
time, bound together by the shared honor of being bad.

45. The Rattlesnake Tribute A boy reckons that flowers are frail and useless. If he wants to show a girl the
depth of his regard, he gives her something with durability. A rattlesnake rattle, dried and shaking with a sinister hiss,
is a gift of high value. It implies danger; it implies that he conquered a beast to bring her this
trophy. He presents it with a flourish. He expects her to marvel at his bravery. Instead, she screams and runs
away. He stands there, holding the rattle, confused by the female inability to appreciate the grim grandeur of nature. He
puts it back in his pocket, deciding she is perhaps not worthy of his best artifacts.

46. The Art of the Cold Shoulder When love turns sour—usually because she let another boy carry her slate—the boy resorts
to the "Cut Direct." He decides to ignore her so thoroughly that she will wither away from lack of his
attention. He walks past her with his nose in the air, whistling a tune to show his absolute unconcern. He
looks at the clouds; he looks at the fence; he looks anywhere but at her. It is a performance of
indifference that requires immense concentration. Usually, she is talking to her friends and doesn't even notice he has passed. He
reaches the end of the block, looks back, sees her laughing, and realizes that his punishing silence has punished only
himself.

47. The Mirror's Testimony A boy in love spends an inordinate amount of time in front of the mirror, searching for
a handsome man who refuses to appear. He examines his nose and finds it too large. He examines his freckles
and finds them too numerous. He practices different expressions: the Stern Commander, the Tragic Poet, the Jolly Fellow. None of
them sit right. He grimaces, baring his teeth to check for spinach. He is trying to solve the puzzle of
his own face. He wonders how anyone could love such a collection of features. He sighs, plasters his hair down
one last time, and goes out to face his fate, hoping his personality is better than his reflection.

48. The Long Goodbye The conversation at the gate is the longest ritual in Christendom. The boy has walked her home.
He has nothing left to say. She has nothing left to say. Yet, neither can bear to part. He swings
on the gate, making the hinges shriek. She twists her apron. They look at the moon. They look at their
feet. "Well," he says. "Well," she replies. Ten minutes pass. The father opens the window and shouts that it is
time for bed. They jump apart as if shot. The spell is broken, but that ten minutes of awkward silence
was the most eloquent conversation they ever had.

49. The Maternal Inquisition A mother knows when her son is in love by the smell of the soap. When he
comes to the table smelling like a rose garden instead of a wet dog, she becomes suspicious. She asks him
who he walked with. He turns the color of a beet and says, "Nobody." She smiles that terrible, knowing smile.
She asks if "Nobody" has yellow curls. The father laughs behind his paper. The boy feels the walls closing in.
He realizes that there is no privacy in a house where people wash your neck; his heart is an open
book to the woman who scrubs his laundry.

50. The Weather-Vane Heart The heart of a boy is a weather-vane, spinning with the winds of opportunity. On Monday, he
is ready to die for the girl in the blue dress. On Tuesday, a new girl arrives with a pony,
and the blue dress is forgotten. He does not feel he is fickle; he feels he is an explorer discovering
new continents. He transfers his allegiance without a backward glance. The carvings on the tree, the notes in the knot-hole—they
are abandoned monuments to a past civilization. He lives in the eternal present, where the prettiest girl is always the
one standing right in front of him.

Here is the final batch (51–62) of paragraphs on "Love and Romance," completing the chronicle of the tender passion.

Batch 6: The End of the Affair 51. The Engagement of Convenience Occasionally, two children find themselves "engaged" not out
of passion, but out of boredom and a shared surplus of gum. They sit on a log, chewing in unison.
"We are married now," the boy announces, having little idea what that entails but assuming it means he can boss
her around. "Yes," she says, assuming it means she can take his marbles. It is a contract based on mutual
misunderstanding. They play house for ten minutes, during which they argue over who has to fetch the water. They decide
that marriage is too much work and dissolve the union by mutual consent before the gum loses its flavor.

52. The Tragedy of the Haircut Just as a boy is making progress with his beloved, his mother decides he looks
like a wild beast and drags him to the barber (or worse, the kitchen stool). She orders a "summer cut,"
which means shearing him like a sheep until his ears stick out like handles on a jug. He walks to
school the next day wearing a hat pulled down to his nose. He hides in the cloakroom. When he is
forced to reveal himself, the girl laughs. It is a betrayal. He feels naked and ridiculous. He decides that Samson
was right about women and hair, and he plots a life of solitary revenge.

53. The Note Intercepted The passing of a note is a high-stakes operation. The boy folds the paper into a tight
square. He waits for the teacher to turn to the blackboard. He passes it to the boy in front, who
passes it to the girl. But the chain of custody is weak. The teacher turns. "Bring that here," she commands.
The long walk to the front of the room is a death march. The teacher opens the note. She reads
aloud: "Your eyes are like marbles." The class erupts. The boy wishes for a trapdoor to swallow him. The girl
turns crimson. The romance is dead, killed by the harsh light of public literacy.

54. The Phantom Rival Often, a boy is jealous of a rival who does not exist. He sees her talking to
the butcher’s boy and assumes a secret engagement. He sees her smiling at a letter and assumes it is from
a lover (it is from her grandmother). He tortures himself with imaginary betrayals. He stalks around the schoolyard, muttering. He
treats her with cold disdain. When she finally asks him what is wrong, and he accuses her of loving the
butcher’s boy, she looks at him as if he is mad. He realizes he has been fighting a ghost, but
his pride prevents him from admitting it, so he stays angry just to be consistent.

55. The Gift of the Dead Bat A boy’s idea of a romantic gift is shaped by what he values. He
finds a bat that has died of natural causes. It is perfect: furry, fragile, and grotesque. He puts it in
a box. He imagines she will be thrilled by the scientific wonder of it. He leaves it on her desk.
When she opens it, the scream shatters the schoolhouse windows. The teacher rushes in. The boy is identified as the
culprit. He is punished, baffled by the injustice. He honestly thought he was giving her a treasure. He concludes that
girls have no appreciation for natural history and are therefore unworthy of his best finds.

56. The Sermon on Marriage The parson preaches on the sanctity of marriage, describing it as a yoke and a burden
to be borne with patience. The boy listens, horrified. He looks at his parents. His father is asleep; his mother
is frowning at a stain on his coat. This does not look like the romances in the books. It looks
like a long, quiet war. He wonders why anyone would volunteer for such a fate. He decides that the parson
is right about the "burden" part, and he reckons he will stay single and keep his freedom, his fishing pole,
and his silence.

57. The Unrequited Snowball Winter offers a unique method of courtship: the snowball. A boy expresses his affection by hitting a
girl in the ear with a ball of packed ice. It is a primitive instinct—to mark one's territory with a
projectile. He waits for her to come out of school. He aims. He fires. Thwack. She bursts into tears. He
runs over, expecting her to laugh, but finds he has actually hurt her. He feels like a monster. He tries
to brush the snow off her coat, apologizing frantically. She pushes him away. He learns that violence, even when motivated
by love, is rarely received as a compliment.

58. The Spectacle of the Older Sister The boy watches his older sister’s courtship with a mixture of fascination and disgust.
Her beau sits in the parlor, sweating and talking about the weather. His sister giggles at things that are not
funny. They drink tea with their pinkies out. They look like two idiots trying to be people. The boy hides
behind the sofa, making gagging noises. He swears he will never be so foolish. He will never wear a stiff
collar; he will never giggle. He is ignorant of the fact that in five years, he will be sitting in
a different parlor, holding a different teacup, looking exactly the same kind of fool.

59. The Final Parting The end of childhood love often comes with a move. The girl’s father decides to go West,
or to the next town. The news strikes the boy like a hammer. The last day arrives. They stand by
the wagon. He wants to say something memorable, something eternal. He wants to say, "I will wait for you." Instead,
he kicks the dirt and says, "Goodbye." She gives him a ribbon; he gives her a marble. The wagon rolls
away. He watches the dust settle. He feels a hole in his chest. He goes to the river and throws
stones at the water, angry at the world for being so large and at himself for being so small.

60. The Memory of the Ribbon Years later, the boy finds a faded blue ribbon in a box of old treasures,
nestled between a broken knife and a fishhook. He picks it up. For a moment, he cannot remember where it
came from. Then, the smell of lavender and the image of yellow braids come back to him. He remembers the
heat of the schoolhouse and the terror of the valentine. He smiles, a little sadly. The passion that once threatened
to consume him is now just a dusty scrap of cloth. He puts it back in the box and closes
the lid, grateful that he survived the fever of youth to become a man who can eat his corn in
peace.

61. The Wisdom of the Bachelor There is an old bachelor in town who sits on a barrel at the general
store, whittling. He listens to the boys talk of girls and shakes his head. "Women," he says, "are a puzzle
with no answer." He tells them of the freedom of the single life—no curtains to hang, no carpets to beat.
The boys listen with respect. They admire his independence. But as they walk home, they see the light in the
windows of the married houses, and they hear the laughter inside. They look at the bachelor’s dark cabin, cold and
silent. They reckon that while freedom is a fine thing, a puzzle with no answer might be better than no
puzzle at all.

62. The Eternal Cycle The boy grows up. He puts away his marbles and his dead bats. He buys a razor.
He buys a stiff collar. One day, he walks down the street and sees a girl—not with the eyes of
a child, but with the eyes of a man. She drops her handkerchief. He picks it up. Their fingers touch.
The old fever returns, hotter and stronger than before. He forgets his vows of bachelorhood. He forgets the logic of
the dog. He straightens his tie, clears his throat, and steps off the precipice once more, ready to make a
fool of himself for the sake of a pair of eyes, just as his father did before him.
