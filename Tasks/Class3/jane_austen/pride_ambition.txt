1. The Ambition of Connection It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune
must be in want of a wife, provided that wife brings with her a connection that does not disgrace his
family tree. A young gentleman of ambitious views often looks upon marriage less as a union of hearts than as
a merger of estates. He calculates the value of a father-in-law’s influence in the same manner he calculates the yield
of a turnip field. To marry a woman with a fine pair of eyes but no uncle in the admiralty
is considered a romantic imprudence; to marry a woman with a face like a pudding but a cousin in the
peerage is considered the height of good sense. The heart is a very fine thing, but it cannot secure a
commission or a living, and in the great business of rising in the world, affection is a luxury that the
prudent man can ill afford.

2. The Pride of Ancestry There is a species of pride which derives its entire nourishment from the grave. A family
that has done nothing of note for three generations often prides itself on the achievements of a great-grandfather who was
once a colonel. They polish his reputation daily. They speak of "The Family" as if it were a separate nation,
possessed of virtues unknown to the common herd. A young lady of this house is taught to view the world
through the lens of her own consequence. She may lack beauty, wit, or fortune, but she possesses a pedigree, and
this single fact is sufficient to make her look down upon a neighbor whose grandfather was in trade, even if
that neighbor is currently supporting the entire parish with his benevolence.

3. The Ambition of the Mother The ambition of a mother for her daughter is a force of nature that brooks
no opposition. She views every ball as a campaign and every dinner party as a siege. Her eye is a
telescope, scanning the horizon for eligible bachelors. She maneuvers her daughter into the path of a wealthy baronet with the
skill of a general. If the young lady expresses a preference for a curate with a small living, the mother’s
indignation knows no bounds. She speaks of "duty" and "prudence," words which in her vocabulary mean "carriages" and "pin money."
To see her child settled in a large house, even if it is a house of correction, is the summit
of her earthly desires, proving that maternal love is often but a disguised form of personal vanity.

4. The Pride of Intellect A gentleman who prides himself on his understanding is often the most insufferable of companions. He
reads deep books; he quotes Latin; he corrects the grammar of his friends. He views the conversation of the dinner
table as a lecture hall where he is the sole professor. He listens to the opinions of others with a
smile of condescending pity, waiting only for a pause to demonstrate their error. He mistakes knowledge for wisdom and memory
for genius. To be right is his only object, and he will sacrifice the comfort of the entire company to
prove a point of history that no one cares about, leaving his audience to wish that he possessed less learning
and more manners.

5. The Ambition of the Younger Son The position of a younger son is one of peculiar difficulty. Born to the
same tastes and education as his elder brother, he is denied the means to gratify them. He must make his
way in the world by his wits or his sword. Ambition, to him, is not a luxury but a necessity.
He looks at the church, the law, or the army, not as callings, but as ladders. He must climb or
sink. He learns early that he must be agreeable where his brother can be merely polite, and clever where his
brother can be merely rich. His ambition is a hunger that drives him to seek a fortune in India or
a wife in the city, knowing that the only crime society will not forgive in a younger son is poverty.

6. The Pride of the Nouveau Riche The man who has made his own fortune is often possessed of a pride
more aggressive than that of the man who inherited it. He builds a house that is too large; he buys
horses that are too fast; he gives dinners that are too long. He is anxious that the world should know
the price of everything he owns. He speaks loudly of his "humble beginnings" in a tone that invites contradiction. He
is sensitive to the slightest slight, suspecting that the county families are laughing at his manners. His ambition has raised
him to a height where he is visible to all, but his pride prevents him from being comfortable, for he
is always waiting for the applause that he feels is due to his bank account.

7. The Ambition of the Governess In the quiet corner of the schoolroom, ambition may burn as fiercely as in the
cabinet. The governess, born perhaps to better things but reduced by misfortune, looks at her charges with a mixture of
envy and hope. She sees the young ladies she instructs destined for balls and marriages from which she is excluded.
Her ambition is necessarily limited: to save a pittance for her old age, or perhaps, by some miracle of romance,
to attract the notice of a widowed father or a serious uncle. She cultivates her accomplishments as weapons in a
silent war against obscurity, knowing that her only escape from a life of dependency lies in the very talents she
is paid to sell to others.

8. The Pride of the Spinster A single woman of small fortune is often the custodian of a pride that is
her only defense against the world. She cannot boast of a husband or children; she boasts instead of her connections,
her recipes, or her propriety. She is severe upon the follies of the young; she is critical of the extravagance
of the married. She wraps herself in a mantle of dignity that is stiff with starch. If she is not
loved, she is determined to be respected. She refuses invitations that she considers beneath her, preferring a solitary egg in
her own parlor to a feast where she might be placed below the salt, proving that pride is often the
last comfort of the lonely.

9. The Ambition of the Toady There is a species of ambition that seeks to rise by crawling. The toady attaches
himself to a man of rank or fortune, becoming a shadow that flatters and agrees. He laughs at jokes that
are not funny; he praises opinions that are absurd. His object is to be useful, to be indispensable, and ultimately,
to be provided for. He swallows insults as if they were sweetmeats. He has no pride of his own, having
bartered it for the hope of a living or a legacy. He rises in the world like a balloon, inflated
by the breath of another, and when his patron falls, he collapses into the nothingness from which he came.

10. The Pride of Virtue The most dangerous form of pride is that which disguises itself as virtue. A lady who
prides herself on her "frankness" is often merely rude; a man who prides himself on his "honesty" is often merely
unfeeling. We see the Pharisee who thanks God he is not as other men, while secretly enjoying the comparison. He
gives to charity, not from pity, but to demonstrate his superiority. He forgives his enemies with a loud voice, so
that all may admire his magnanimity. This spiritual pride is a fortress that is almost impregnable, for the man who
believes himself to be perfect has lost the capacity for self-examination, and with it, the hope of improvement.

11. The Pride of the Refused Suitor A gentleman who has offered his hand and been declined faces a trial of
character that separates the man of sense from the man of vanity. The latter views the refusal as an insult
to his consequence; he cannot conceive how a lady of moderate fortune could be blind to the merits of his
estate. He attributes her decision to the influence of a scheming aunt or a prior, secret attachment to a worthless
rival. He retreats into a fortress of offended dignity, speaking of the lady with a cold disdain that betrays his
mortification. To accept rejection with grace, to acknowledge that a lady has a right to the disposal of her own
happiness, is a height of philosophy to which few rejected lovers can attain.

12. The Ambition of the Social Climber There is a laborious art to rising in the world which requires the patience
of a saint and the hide of a rhinoceros. The aspiring hostess studies the guest lists of the great houses
as a general studies a map. She endures the snubs of the high-born with a smile; she swallows the insolence
of their servants. Her object is to be seen in a carriage with a title, or to have it whispered
that she dined at the Park. Every invitation is a rung on the ladder. She drops old friends who are
no longer useful with the same ease that she drops a handkerchief, proving that in the economy of ambition, friendship
is merely a currency to be spent on advancement.

13. The Pride of the Beauty A young lady possessed of a face that has been praised since the nursery often
walks through the world with the air of a queen visiting her subjects. She expects admiration as a tribute due
to her complexion. She enters a room with the certainty that every eye will be fixed upon her. If a
gentleman speaks to another, she considers it a personal slight. Her conversation is often limited, for she has never found
the need to be anything but decorative. She is a statue that demands worship, unaware that beauty without wit is
a flower that fades quickly, leaving behind only the thorny stem of vanity.

14. The Military Ambition The arrival of a regiment in a country town is a spark to the ambition of every
younger son who looks well in a red coat. The young officer dreams of glory, but more often, he dreams
of a heiress. He views the ballroom as a field of maneuver. He calculates the fortunes of the young ladies
with a precision he rarely applies to his regimental accounts. To capture a fortune of ten thousand pounds is a
victory greater than Waterloo. He dances with energy and flirts with a recklessness that suggests his heart is as light
as his purse, hoping to exchange his commission for a comfortable estate and a father-in-law who pays the bills.

15. The Pride of the Improver A gentleman who has recently inherited an estate is often seized by a mania for
"improvement." He cannot look at a tree without wishing to cut it down; he cannot look at a hill without
wishing to level it. He bores his guests with long dissertations on the price of timber and the advantages of
a new fence. He drags them through mud to admire a view that was perfectly visible from the drawing room
window. He considers himself a man of taste, when in reality he is merely a man of restlessness. His pride
lies in altering the face of nature to suit his own caprice, forgetting that a landscape, like a character, is
often ruined by too much correction.

16. The Ambition of the Clergyman In a profession dedicated to humility, it is curious to observe how often the eye
is fixed upon preferment. The ambitious clergyman cultivates the acquaintance of the patron with a zeal that borders on devotion.
He agrees with the squire’s politics; he laughs at the bishop’s jokes. He preaches sermons that are carefully calculated to
offend no one. His vision of paradise includes a parsonage with a large garden and a tithe of five hundred
a year. He views the church not merely as a cure of souls, but as a career, where the salvation
of the parish is happily compatible with a very comfortable dinner at the rectory.

17. The Pride of the "Sensible" Woman There is a type of lady who prides herself on having no nonsense about
her. She despises poetry; she laughs at romance. She views the world with a cold, clear eye, regulating her life
by the strictest rules of economy and decorum. She marries a man for his house, not his conversation. She considers
herself superior to the foolish girls who weep over novels. Yet, this pride of "good sense" is often a mask
for a lack of feeling. In barring the door against folly, she often bars it against happiness, living a life
that is perfectly prudent, perfectly orderly, and perfectly joyless.

18. The Ambition of the Matchmaker To arrange the destiny of others is a temptation that few active minds can resist.
The neighborhood matchmaker views the unmarried population as pieces on a chessboard. She plots; she whispers; she arranges accidental meetings
in the shrubbery. She is driven by a desire for power, disguising it as benevolence. If a marriage succeeds, she
claims the credit; if it fails, she blames the perversity of the parties. Her ambition is to be the architect
of the county’s future, finding a vicarious romance in the courtship of others that compensates for the dullness of her
own fireside.

19. The Pride of the Recluse A gentleman who withdraws from society often does so not from humility, but from a
pride that cannot bear competition. He shuts himself up in his library, declaring the world to be comprised of fools.
He refuses invitations because he fears he will not be the first man in the company. He cultivates a reputation
for eccentricity. By removing himself from the test of comparison, he preserves his own opinion of his superiority. He is
a monarch in a kingdom of one, ruling over his books and his servants with an absolute sway, safe from
the intrusion of equals who might challenge his self-importance.

20. The Ambition of the Amateur A young lady who has mastered "The Battle of Prague" on the pianoforte often nurtures
a secret ambition to outshine all rivals. She sits down to the instrument with an air of false modesty, protesting
her lack of practice. She then proceeds to pound the keys with a vigor that threatens the strings. She looks
around for applause, measuring her success by the silence of the room. She mistakes the politeness of the audience for
admiration. Her ambition is to be the center of the circle, unaware that while her music may be loud, the
relief of the company when she ceases is louder still.

21. The Conflict of Prides There is a silent war often waged in the drawing room between the Pride of Intellect
and the Pride of Wealth. The gentleman of limited income but extensive reading looks upon the gentleman of vast estate
but limited understanding with a mixture of scorn and envy. He consoles himself with a quotation from Horace while his
rival consoles himself with a new carriage. The scholar believes that mind is the only true aristocracy; the rich man
believes that a bank account is the only true pedigree. They meet with a polite hostility, each despising the other
for possessing the one thing he secretly covets, proving that while money cannot buy wisdom, wisdom is often a poor
substitute for a good dinner.

22. The Ambition of the Rake To a gentleman of easy manners and loose principles, the world is an oyster to
be opened with the knife of charm. His ambition is not to be useful, but to be agreeable. He views
the affections of young ladies as a currency to be spent on his own amusement. He dances with spirit; he
smiles with meaning; he contracts debts with the confidence of a man who believes that the world owes him a
living. He is the hero of the ballroom and the terror of the father. His pride lies in his power
to please, and his ambition is to secure a fortune without the tedious necessity of earning it.

23. The Pride of the Country Squire A gentleman who is the first man in his own village often finds his
consequence sadly diminished when he ventures to London. In the country, his opinion on the weather is law; in town,
it is a bore. He is accustomed to the bows of his tenants; he is unprepared for the indifference of
the multitude. He returns to his estate with a bruised dignity, railing against the noise and the folly of the
metropolis. He finds comfort in the homage of his parish, where he can once again be a giant among pygmies,
secure in the knowledge that while he may be nobody in St. James’s, he is everything at the Hall.

24. The Ambition of the "Old" Family There is a melancholy pride that clings to a decaying house like ivy to
a ruin. The family whose fortune has been dissipated by generations of extravagance often maintains a state that is both
pathetic and proud. They eat off silver plate that is nearly worn through; they drive a carriage that is twenty
years out of fashion. They refuse to know the new mill owner who has bought the adjacent estate, preferring their
own dignified poverty to his vulgar prosperity. Their ambition is simply to endure, to keep the name alive, and to
pretend that the world has not changed since the reign of George the Second.

25. The Pride of the Critic To find fault is the easiest of all intellectual exercises, and the one most flattering
to the vanity. The self-appointed critic of the neighborhood sits in judgment on the dress, the manners, and the morals
of his acquaintance. He condemns a bonnet as "frivolous" and a sermon as "unsound." He believes that his severity is
a proof of his superior taste. He does not realize that his fastidiousness is merely a mask for a lack
of sympathy. He is a man who would rather be right than be happy, and who succeeds in making everyone
around him wish that he were a little less wise and a little more blind.

26. The Ambition of the Younger Sister To be the younger sister of a beauty is a trial that requires a
peculiar kind of ambition. While the elder receives the compliments and the proposals, the younger must be content with the
second-best partner and the second-best bonnet. She learns to be "lively" where her sister is "elegant," and "sensible" where her
sister is "accomplished." Her ambition is to step out of the shadow, to find a gentleman who prefers conversation to
complexion. She watches the courtship of her sister with a critical eye, hoping that when the great beauty is finally
married, the world will have time to notice the girl who has been holding her shawl.

27. The Pride of the "Sensible" Man A gentleman who prides himself on his rationality is often the most irrational of
lovers. He approaches marriage as he would a business transaction. He looks for a wife who is "suitable," "prudent," and
"healthy." He despises the "romantic nonsense" of passion. When he is finally captivated by a pair of fine eyes or
a playful manner, he is the last to admit it. He rationalizes his feelings; he argues with his heart. He
ends by making a proposal that is as logical as a legal brief, and is astonished when the lady, preferring
a little warmth to a great deal of sense, declines the honor of managing his household.

28. The Ambition of the Debutante The first season in London is the battlefield of the ambitious debutante. She has been
trained for this moment since the nursery. She knows exactly how much a smile is worth and how to use
a fan to discourage a younger son. Her eye is fixed on the coronet; her heart is kept in reserve.
She dances with a determination that is terrifying to behold. She is a soldier of fortune in white muslin, fighting
for a settlement that will secure her future. If she succeeds, she is the envy of her friends; if she
fails, she returns to the country to face the horror of a second winter without a ring.

29. The Pride of the Invalid To be ill is a misfortune; to be proud of being ill is a perversity.
There are those who cherish their ailments as if they were jewels. They speak of their "delicate constitutions" with a
boastful air. They demand the consideration of the healthy as a right. They use their weakness to tyrannize over the
strong. A headache becomes a reason to cancel a ball; a flutter of the nerves becomes a reason to demand
a trip to Bath. Their pride lies in their fragility, and their ambition is to be the center of a
circle of anxious sympathizers, proving that even in the sickroom, vanity can find a throne.

30. The Ambition of the Final Settlement In the end, the great ambition of society resolves itself into the simple desire
for a "good settlement." Whether it is the mother plotting for her daughter, or the gentleman plotting for himself, the
object is the same: security. We laugh at the maneuvers of the matchmaker and the calculations of the fortune hunter,
yet we all, in our hearts, acknowledge the truth. To be settled, to be safe, to have a place in
the world that is recognized and respected—this is the universal goal. It is a prose ambition, perhaps, lacking the poetry
of high romance, but it is the foundation upon which the comedy of our lives is built.

31. The Pride of the Patroness Lady Catherine, having taken a young woman of small fortune under her protection, considered herself
a monument of benevolence. She dictated the girl’s dress; she corrected her pronunciation; she advised her on the management of
her poultry. Her pride lay in the exercise of authority, disguised as friendship. She expected a gratitude that was vocal
and constant. To be the object of her charity was to be a slave in satin, for the patroness never
allowed her protégé to forget that every ribbon she wore and every opinion she held was a gift from a
superior intelligence.

32. The Ambition of the Political Wife A gentleman’s seat in Parliament is often the project of his wife’s ambition rather
than his own. She canvasses the neighborhood with a zeal that alarms the voters. She smiles at butchers; she kisses
babies who are not clean. She endures the tedious dinners of the mayor with a heroism worthy of a martyr.
Her object is to see her husband frank a letter and to hear herself addressed as the wife of a
Member. She pushes him up the greasy pole of politics, not because he has a passion for legislation, but because
she has a passion for a house in town and a ticket to the gallery.

33. The Pride of the Self-Made Man Mr. Suckling, having amassed a fortune in the Bristol trade, purchased an estate with
the intention of founding a dynasty. He walked his boundaries with a heavy tread, as if to stamp his ownership
into the soil. He spoke loudly of the price of his gates and the cost of his pineapples. He regarded
the ancient families of the county with a mixture of envy and contempt, calling them "decayed." His pride was the
pride of the purse, a noisy, clinking thing that demanded attention, unaware that the silence of the old aristocracy was
a fortress against which his guineas beat in vain.

34. The Ambition of the Younger Brother The younger son of a peer faces the world with a title that is
a courtesy and a pocket that is empty. His ambition is a desperate game of musical chairs. He must secure
a place before the music stops. He looks at the heiress of a merchant with a calculating eye. He weighs
the disgrace of trade against the comfort of a paid tailor. He dances with the daughter of a sugar baker,
whispering compliments that are as sweet and as hollow as her father’s wares. His pride rebels, but his necessities insist,
and he marries the money, consoling himself that while his wife may be vulgar, her dowry is impeccable.

35. The Pride of the "Superior" Woman There is a lady who prides herself on being "above" the common amusements of
her sex. She does not dance; she does not gossip; she does not care for dress. She sits in the
corner of the ballroom with a book, or engages the curate in a discussion on the Poor Laws. She views
the laughter of the young with a cold smile of superiority. She believes she is demonstrating her intellect; the room
believes she is demonstrating her conceit. Her pride isolates her in a tower of silence, where she remains unapproached and
unloved, a monument to the folly of despising the very society in which one must live.

36. The Ambition of the Match-Breaking Mother It is often the ambition of a mother not to make a match, but
to break one. Mrs. Ferrars, having decided that her son should marry a woman of ten thousand pounds, viewed his
attachment to a woman of three with the horror of a contagion. She employed every weapon in the arsenal of
maternal tyranny. She threatened disinheritance; she feigned illness; she insulted the lady’s family. Her ambition was to secure a connection
that would aggrandize the name, regardless of the happiness of the bearer. She succeeded in separating the lovers, only to
find herself the mother of a son who was rich, dutiful, and profoundly miserable.

37. The Pride of the Virtuoso A gentleman who collects antiquities often prides himself on a taste that is superior to
the vulgar herd. He fills his house with broken statues and illegible coins. He bores his guests with the history
of a rusty spearhead. He values a thing not for its beauty, but for its age. He looks down on
the man who admires a modern painting as a barbarian. His pride is a dusty, musty thing, dwelling in the
past and blind to the present, proving that a man may be surrounded by the treasures of art and yet
remain a pauper in the currency of human sympathy.

38. The Ambition of the Parasite Mr. Collins, having no merit of his own, sought to borrow consequence by attaching himself
to the great. His ambition was to be the humble servant of a noble patroness. He studied her whims; he
flattered her follies. He formulated his opinions to match hers before she had even spoken them. He viewed himself as
a model of clerical humility, when in truth he was a monster of clerical pride—the pride of being chosen, of
being noticed, of being allowed to walk in the shadow of a title. He rose in the world by the
strength of his knees, which were always ready to bend.

39. The Pride of the Beauty in Decline The woman who has been a beauty and is now merely handsome often
clings to her former supremacy with a desperate pride. She cannot bear to abdicate the throne. She dresses in the
style of a girl of twenty; she flirts with the contemporaries of her son. She views every young debutante as
a personal rival. She fishes for compliments with a net that has too large a mesh. Her pride refuses to
acknowledge the calendar, leading her into a masquerade of youth that deceives no one but herself, and excites the pity
of those who remember her in her glory.

40. The Ambition of the Country Town In the microcosm of a country town, ambition rages as fiercely as in the
capital. The attorney’s wife wishes to outshine the surgeon’s wife; the banker’s daughter wishes to marry the squire’s son. A
new bonnet is a declaration of war; a dinner party is a diplomatic maneuver. The struggle for precedence at the
assembly is a matter of life and death. To be the first lady in a village of five hundred souls
is an ambition that consumes the energy of a Caesar, proving that the size of the stage matters little to
the actors who are determined to play the lead.

41. The Pride of the "Old Maid" A single woman of small fortune is often the custodian of a pride that
is her only defense against the world. She cannot boast of a husband or children; she boasts instead of her
connections, her recipes, or her propriety. She is severe upon the follies of the young; she is critical of the
extravagance of the married. She wraps herself in a mantle of dignity that is stiff with starch. If she is
not loved, she is determined to be respected. She refuses invitations that she considers beneath her, preferring a solitary egg
in her own parlor to a feast where she might be placed below the salt, proving that pride is often
the last comfort of the lonely.

42. The Ambition of the Clergy In a profession dedicated to humility, it is curious to observe how often the eye
is fixed upon preferment. The ambitious clergyman cultivates the acquaintance of the patron with a zeal that borders on devotion.
He agrees with the squire’s politics; he laughs at the bishop’s jokes. He preaches sermons that are carefully calculated to
offend no one. His vision of paradise includes a parsonage with a large garden and a tithe of five hundred
a year. He views the church not merely as a cure of souls, but as a career, where the salvation
of the parish is happily compatible with a very comfortable dinner at the rectory.

43. The Pride of the Pedigree Sir Walter Elliot, having little else to recommend him but a name that appeared in
the Baronetage, clung to his ancestry with a desperation that was pathetic. He read the entry of his family history
every evening as if it were a chapter of Holy Writ. He valued a man not for his character, but
for his grandfather. He could forgive a lack of sense, or a lack of money, but he could never forgive
a lack of blood. His pride was a fortress built of paper, defending him against the encroachment of a world
that was beginning to suspect that a title without merit is but a gilded toy.

44. The Ambition of the "Accomplished" Woman To catch a husband requires a strategy as complex as a military campaign. The
young lady who is determined to marry well arms herself with accomplishments. She learns to sing Italian songs she does
not understand; she learns to paint flowers she has never seen. She displays her talents in the drawing room with
a modest air that conceals a ruthless purpose. She is a siren in silk, luring the unwary bachelor onto the
rocks of matrimony. Her ambition is to secure a listener who is legally bound to applaud her for the rest
of his life.

45. The Pride of the Intellect Mr. Bennet, finding himself married to a woman of mean understanding, took refuge in the
pride of his own wit. He laughed at the follies of his neighbors; he mocked the absurdities of his wife.
He believed his cynicism to be wisdom. He withdrew into his library, content to be a spectator of the human
comedy rather than an actor. His pride lay in his detachment, a cold and sterile thing that protected him from
pain but also from love, leaving him a stranger in his own house, respected for his cleverness but unloved for
his heart.

46. The Ambition of the Younger Son The position of a younger son is one of peculiar difficulty. Born to the
same tastes and education as his elder brother, he is denied the means to gratify them. He must make his
way in the world by his wits or his sword. Ambition, to him, is not a luxury but a necessity.
He looks at the church, the law, or the army, not as callings, but as ladders. He must climb or
sink. He learns early that he must be agreeable where his brother can be merely polite, and clever where his
brother can be merely rich. His ambition is a hunger that drives him to seek a fortune in India or
a wife in the city.

47. The Pride of the Recluse A gentleman who withdraws from society often does so not from humility, but from a
pride that cannot bear competition. He shuts himself up in his library, declaring the world to be comprised of fools.
He refuses invitations because he fears he will not be the first man in the company. He cultivates a reputation
for eccentricity. By removing himself from the test of comparison, he preserves his own opinion of his superiority. He is
a monarch in a kingdom of one, ruling over his books and his servants with an absolute sway.

48. The Ambition of the Matchmaker To arrange the destiny of others is a temptation that few active minds can resist.
The neighborhood matchmaker views the unmarried population as pieces on a chessboard. She plots; she whispers; she arranges accidental meetings
in the shrubbery. She is driven by a desire for power, disguising it as benevolence. If a marriage succeeds, she
claims the credit; if it fails, she blames the perversity of the parties. Her ambition is to be the architect
of the county’s future, finding a vicarious romance in the courtship of others that compensates for the dullness of her
own fireside.

49. The Pride of the "Sensible" Woman There is a type of lady who prides herself on having no nonsense about
her. She despises poetry; she laughs at romance. She views the world with a cold, clear eye, regulating her life
by the strictest rules of economy and decorum. She marries a man for his house, not his conversation. She considers
herself superior to the foolish girls who weep over novels. Yet, this pride of "good sense" is often a mask
for a lack of feeling. In barring the door against folly, she often bars it against happiness.

50. The Ambition of the Final Settlement In the end, the great ambition of society resolves itself into the simple desire
for a "good settlement." Whether it is the mother plotting for her daughter, or the gentleman plotting for himself, the
object is the same: security. We laugh at the maneuvers of the matchmaker and the calculations of the fortune hunter,
yet we all, in our hearts, acknowledge the truth. To be settled, to be safe, to have a place in
the world that is recognized and respected—this is the universal goal. It is a prose ambition, perhaps, lacking the poetry
of high romance, but it is the foundation upon which the comedy of our lives is built.

51. The Pride of the "Plain" Woman A lady who possesses neither beauty nor fortune often cultivates a pride of intellect
that serves as her shield against the indifference of the world. She professes to despise the frivolity of balls and
the emptiness of compliments. She sits in judgment on the "silly girls" who giggle at officers, thanking Providence that she
has a mind above such trifles. Yet, this pride is often a solitary fortress. In declaring herself superior to the
game of courtship, she saves herself the mortification of not being asked to play, finding a cold comfort in the
conviction that if she is not admired, it is only because she is too wise to be understood by the
common herd.

52. The Ambition of the Reformer There is a species of ambition that disguises itself as a desire to improve the
world, when its true object is to govern the neighborhood. The lady who organizes the village school or regulates the
morals of the cottagers often does so with a tyranny that would shame a despot. She equates her own will
with the will of Heaven. She distributes tracts and soup with the same air of command, expecting the poor to
be not only grateful but obedient. Her ambition is to be the conscience of the parish, a role that allows
her to pry into the cottages of the poor and the consciences of the rich with an authority that no
one dares to challenge.

53. The Pride of the Stoic To suffer in silence is a virtue, but to make a display of one’s silence
is a form of pride. The gentleman who bears a disappointment or a loss with an iron countenance often wishes
the world to marvel at his fortitude. He refuses sympathy as if it were an insult. He walks through the
ruins of his hopes with a measured tread, proving that he is superior to the accidents of fortune. Yet, this
stoicism is often a mask for a deep resentment. By refusing to admit to pain, he denies his friends the
opportunity to offer comfort, preferring the solitary dignity of the rock to the warm, if messy, consolations of humanity.

54. The Ambition of the Second Marriage The ambition of a widow or widower entering into a second engagement is often
tinged with a desire to correct the mistakes of the first. A gentleman whose first wife was a beauty and
a spendthrift looks for a woman of sense and economy; a lady whose first husband was a tyrant looks for
a man of easy temper. They approach the altar not with the blind hope of youth, but with the calculated
optimism of experience. Their ambition is to prove to the world—and perhaps to the shade of their former spouse—that happiness
is a thing that can be managed by prudence, provided one chooses a partner who possesses the exact opposite qualities
of the dear departed.

55. The Pride of the Poor Relation There is no pride so touchy as that of the poor relation living on
the charity of a great family. She is constantly on the watch for slights. She interprets a forgotten civility as
a deliberate insult; she views a cast-off gown as a badge of servitude. She insists on her "independence" even while
eating the bread of dependence. She refuses the carriage when it is offered, preferring to walk in the rain to
demonstrate her humility, which is in fact the most aggressive form of pride. She makes her benefactors pay for their
generosity by forcing them to walk on eggshells, lest they wound a dignity that is as fragile as it is
fierce.

56. The Ambition of the Wit To be known as the wittiest man in the room is an ambition that often
leads to the destruction of friendship. The gentleman who values a jest above a feeling will sacrifice the reputation of
his neighbor for the sake of a laugh. He scans the company for a victim. He caricatures the foibles of
the simple and the affectations of the proud. He is admired, certainly, but he is also feared. His ambition to
shine isolates him, for while men may laugh with a wit, they rarely trust him, knowing that the sword which
is used to amuse the table today may be turned against themselves tomorrow.

57. The Pride of the Misunderstood There is a romantic pride in believing oneself to be too sensitive, too refined, or
too complex for the gross understanding of the ordinary world. The young gentleman who adopts the pose of the melancholy
poet looks down on the cheerful bustle of life with a weary eye. He cherishes his sorrows; he nurses his
gloom. He believes that his unhappiness is a mark of genius. He creates a barrier of "sensibility" between himself and
his neighbors, enjoying the solitude of the misunderstood, unaware that the world is generally too busy with its own concerns
to take the trouble to solve the riddle of his character.

58. The Ambition of the Legacy Hunter The most patient and debasing of all ambitions is that of the legacy hunter.
To wait for dead men’s shoes requires a discipline that might have conquered an empire. The hopeful nephew endures the
caprices of an invalid aunt for twenty years. He plays cards without complaining; he agrees with opinions that are absurd;
he fetches shawls and reads sermons. He lives in a state of suspended animation, his entire future mortgaged on a
funeral. His ambition is a gamble against time and the whims of a testator, and the tragedy often lies in
the discovery that the estate, when it finally falls, has been consumed by the very longevity he was forced to
applaud.

59. The Pride of the Unsentimental Mr. Gardiner prided himself on being a man of business, with no time for the
"nonsense" of romance or the "folly" of family pride. He judged the world by the ledger. He viewed a marriage
as a merger and a friendship as a credit risk. He believed that his lack of sentiment was a proof
of his superior rationality. He dismissed the anxieties of the heart as the vapors of the idle. His pride lay
in his hardness, a quality he mistook for strength, forgetting that a man who cannot feel is not a philosopher,
but merely a machine for calculating profit and loss.

60. The Ambition of the "Coming Out" The ambition of a mother for her daughter’s first season is a fever that
consumes the entire household. The preparation of the wardrobe, the hiring of the masters, the cultivation of the right acquaintances—all
are directed toward the single great object of the Presentation. The ball is the battlefield; the daughter is the recruit.
The mother’s ambition is to see her child triumph where she perhaps failed, to secure a partner who combines rank
with fortune. She pushes her daughter into the spotlight with a ruthless love, determined that the girl shall fulfill the
destiny that the mother has written for her, regardless of the girl’s own inclination for a quiet life.

61. The Pride of the Survivor There is a dignified pride in the woman who has weathered the storms of life
without losing her composure. She has seen fortunes lost, beauty fade, and friends depart, yet she remains mistress of herself.
She does not solicit pity; she does not indulge in complaint. She wears her shabby silk with the air of
a duchess. She receives the world in her small parlor with a courtesy that makes no apology for her reduced
circumstances. Her pride is not a barrier to others, but a support to herself, a quiet assertion that while circumstances
may change, the essential quality of the lady remains alterable.

62. The Conclusion of Vanity And so, the comedy of pride and ambition plays itself out. We strive for a place,
a name, a fortune, believing that these things will bring us happiness. We climb the ladder only to find that
the view from the top is much the same as the view from the bottom, only colder. The ambitious man
secures his estate but loses his peace; the proud man secures his dignity but loses his friends. In the end,
we learn that the only true ambition worth pursuing is the ambition to be useful, and the only pride that
does not stumble is the pride of a clear conscience. The rest is but a masquerade, a dance of vanity
in a crowded room, where the music eventually stops and the lights must, at last, be extinguished.
