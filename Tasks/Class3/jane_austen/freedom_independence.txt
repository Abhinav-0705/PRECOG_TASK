1. The Definition of Independence It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single woman of large fortune is the only
truly independent creature in the civilized world. A wife must obey her husband; a daughter must obey her father; a
sister must defer to her brother. But a spinster with twenty thousand pounds may defy the county. She may breakfast
at noon; she may keep a carriage of her own; she may express opinions on politics without being silenced. Her
liberty is purchased at the price of romance, perhaps, but to a mind of cynical turn, the ability to order
one's own dinner without consultation is a luxury that compensates for a great deal of solitude.

2. The Freedom of the Widow The condition of widowhood is often looked upon with pity, yet it offers a scope
for action that is denied to the maid or the wife. Mrs. Dashwood, having buried a husband who was "too
good for this world," found herself for the first time in possession of her own soul. She could choose her
own curtains; she could travel to Bath without asking permission; she could spoil her children without interference. The black weeds
of mourning were, in reality, the robes of a new liberty. She wept for the departed, naturally, but her tears
were dried by the refreshing breeze of autonomy, proving that grief is sometimes the gateway to a very comfortable independence.

3. The Tyranny of the Entail To be the heir to a great estate is often called "fortune," but it is
frequently a slavery in disguise. The young master is bound by the dead hand of his ancestors. He cannot sell
a field to pay a debt; he cannot cut a tree to improve a view. He is merely the custodian
of a pile of stones and a genealogy. He walks his grounds not as a master, but as a steward
for the next generation. His freedom is limited to the choice of a wife who will provide the necessary heir,
a choice that is usually dictated by the necessity of merging two adjacent parks rather than two affectionate hearts.

4. The Illusion of Choice A young lady is often told that she is "free to choose" her husband, a sentiment
that is as noble as it is false. Her choice is strictly limited to the three or four gentlemen who
happen to be in the neighborhood, who are of the correct age, and who—most importantly—have asked her. To decline the
first offer is called "fastidiousness"; to decline the second is called "folly." Her freedom consists of saying "yes" to a
man she tolerates or facing a future of dependent spinsterhood. It is the freedom of a prisoner to choose between
the dungeon and the tower.

5. The Liberty of the Carriage There is no symbol of independence so potent as the possession of a carriage. To
be dependent on the kindness of neighbors for a lift to the assembly is a humiliation that eats at the
spirit. It means arriving too early and leaving too late; it means listening to the gossip of the owner without
the power to object. But to step into one’s own barouche, to give the order "To the Park," and to
drive away without obligation—this is the true definition of power. A woman with wheels of her own is a sovereign
state; a woman without them is a vassal.

6. The Freedom of the Mind "I have my own thoughts," says the young lady who has read too many novels.
She believes that intellectual independence is a shield against the world. She nurtures opinions that shock her mother and amuse
her father. She prefers a muddy walk to a quadrille. This liberty of the mind is a fine thing, provided
it does not lead to the liberty of the tongue. For a woman to speak her mind in a drawing
room is to court disaster. She learns, eventually, that the greatest freedom lies in thinking what she likes, while saying
exactly what is expected, keeping her heresy a secret between herself and her diary.

7. The Restraint of "Connections" We are taught that our connections are our strength, but they are often our chains. A
man who wishes to travel, to write, or to live simply, finds himself bound by the expectations of a dozen
aunts and cousins. He must visit them; he must write to them; he must name his children after them. To
break free from the web of family obligation is to incur the charge of "heartlessness." He is pulled in twenty
directions by the invisible threads of kinship, discovering that in a large family, independence is considered a form of selfishness
that borders on insanity.

8. The Economic Reality "Money," says the philosopher, "is the root of all evil." "Money," says the parent, "is the root
of all freedom." Without a competence, there is no liberty. The young man without a profession is a slave to
his creditors; the young woman without a dowry is a slave to her relations. We may praise the nobility of
poverty in a sermon, but in the parlor, we know that five hundred a year is the minimum requirement for
a free conscience. To be able to pay one's bills is the only platform from which one can afford to
look the world in the eye.

9. The Freedom of Obscurity There is a certain liberty to be found in being nobody. The great lady is watched
by a hundred eyes; her every sneeze is chronicled; her every ribbon is criticized. The woman of no consequence walks
through the village unobserved. She may wear a bonnet three seasons old; she may walk without a footman. She is
free from the tyranny of "keeping up appearances." Her obscurity is a cloak that renders her invisible to the demands
of fashion, allowing her to live a life that is perhaps less brilliant, but certainly less exhausting, than that of
her superiors.

10. The Paradox of Marriage Marriage is often presented as the end of a woman’s freedom, the moment she exchanges a
father for a master. Yet, for many, it is the beginning of it. As a matron, she takes precedence over
her unmarried sisters. She has her own house, her own servants, her own tea table. She escapes the nursery and
the schoolroom. She may have to humor a husband, it is true, but if she is a woman of sense,
she soon learns that a husband is a far more manageable creature than a mother, and that the chains of
matrimony, if worn with discretion, can be made to feel remarkably like jewelry.

11. The Independence of the Spinster It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single woman of small fortune is an
object of pity to her married friends, yet she possesses a liberty they have long since bartered for a sideboard
of plate. She is not obliged to consult a husband’s temper before accepting an invitation; she is not required to
feign an interest in the price of corn or the pedigree of a horse. She may read what she likes;
she may walk where she pleases. Her solitude is often populated by a freedom of thought that the mother of
seven has no leisure to cultivate, proving that while a husband is a very fine thing, a quiet house is
a luxury not to be despised.

12. The Tyranny of "Expectations" A young man of good family is often born into a prison of expectations. He must
go to Oxford; he must take orders or the law; he must marry a woman of his own class. To
deviate from this path is to court ruin. He looks with envy at the farmer’s son, who may whistle at
the plough and marry the dairymaid if he chooses. The gentleman is bound by the invisible chains of his station.
He calls himself free, but his every action is dictated by a ghost—the ghost of what his grandfather would have
done—and he walks through life in a straitjacket of propriety that is no less confining for being made of the
finest broadcloth.

13. The Freedom of the Traveler To travel is to escape the tyranny of the neighborhood. A gentleman who goes abroad
leaves behind him the petty jealousies of the parish and the censure of his aunts. He breathes a new air.
He may wear a hat that would be laughed at in the High Street; he may converse with people who
do not know his income. This anonymity is the truest form of freedom. For a few months, he is judged
by his manners and his wit, not by his acres or his connections. He returns home with a lighter step,
having discovered that the world is larger than the card table at the assembly rooms.

14. The Liberty of the Younger Son The younger son, having no estate to manage and no dignity to uphold, is
often the freest member of the family. He is not tied to the land like a serf to the soil.
He may seek his fortune in the army or the navy; he may marry for love, since he cannot afford
to marry for anything else. He is spared the crushing weight of being "The Heir." While his elder brother groans
under the burden of mortgages and tenants, the younger son whistles his way through life, possessing nothing but his own
talents and a very comfortable lack of responsibility.

15. The Restraint of Gratitude There is no chain so heavy as the chain of gratitude. A young lady who lives
on the bounty of a relation is a prisoner of kindness. She must smile when she is sad; she must
agree when she differs. Every ribbon she wears is a reminder of her dependence. She cannot complain, for that would
be "ungrateful." She cannot leave, for that would be "heartless." She learns that the bread of charity is often bitter,
and that true independence consists not in having much, but in needing nothing from those who would exact a price
for their generosity.

16. The Freedom of the "Plain" Woman A woman who has no beauty to lose has a certain freedom from the
anxiety of the mirror. She is not obliged to dress for effect; she is not required to be "charming" to
every bore who approaches her. She may sit in a corner and observe the follies of the flirt with a
cynical eye. She is released from the competition of the ballroom. Her obscurity is a shield. She may cultivate her
mind or her garden without the distraction of admirers, finding a quiet satisfaction in the knowledge that while she may
not be the toast of the evening, she is at least the mistress of her own time.

17. The Tyranny of Fashion We speak of liberty, yet we are all slaves to the milliner. A lady does not
dare to wear a bonnet that is six months old, for fear of being thought "odd." She squeezes her feet
into shoes that are too small; she shivers in muslin in December because it is "the mode." This voluntary servitude
is the most curious of all human follies. We sacrifice our comfort, our health, and our purses to a tyrant
who changes her mind every season. To be truly independent would be to wear what is comfortable and warm, but
such a rebellion would require a courage that even the boldest spirits of the county possess only in their dreams.

18. The Freedom of the Heiress Miss Morton, with thirty thousand pounds, was the arbiter of her own destiny. She could
afford to be eccentric. She could afford to be rude. She could marry a man with no fortune and be
called "romantic," whereas a poorer girl would be called "insane." Her money was a fortress that protected her from the
criticism of the world. She walked through society with the confidence of a queen, knowing that her whims were laws
and her opinions were gospel. Yet, even she was not entirely free, for she lived in constant suspicion of being
loved for her purse rather than her person, a doubt that is the specific burden of the rich.

19. The Liberty of the Pen For a woman of spirit, the pen is the only instrument of true rebellion. In
her letters, she may be as witty, as severe, and as independent as she pleases. She may caricature her neighbors;
she may mock the curate. On paper, she is the equal of any man. She creates a world where she
is the heroine and her dull relations are but the supporting cast. This secret liberty is a safety valve that
prevents the boiler of domestic frustration from exploding. She seals her letter with a smile, having enjoyed a freedom of
expression that the drawing room would never tolerate.

20. The Paradox of Choice We are often told that the modern world offers us too much choice, but in the
matter of marriage, the choice is often between a bad master and no master at all. A young lady looks
at the gentlemen of her acquaintance: one is a fool, one is a tyrant, and one is a bore. To
remain single is to be poor; to marry is to be silenced. She chooses the least of the evils, perhaps
the bore, reasoning that a man who talks too much is better than a man who forbids her to talk
at all. It is a compromise that passes for freedom in a world where the perfect husband is as rare
as a black swan.

21. The Freedom of the Walk To walk alone is the privilege of the gentleman and the scandal of the young
lady. Miss Elizabeth, preferring the solitude of the lanes to the chatter of the drawing room, was often accused of
a "wild" disposition. She found that the mud on her petticoats was a small price to pay for the liberty
of her thoughts. The wind did not criticize her complexion; the trees did not ask her opinion of the sermon.
In the open air, she was not a niece, nor a daughter, nor a potential wife, but simply a creature
of nature, enjoying a brief respite from the tyranny of being agreeable.

22. The Independence of Eccentricity Mr. Woodhouse, having established a reputation for nerves and gruel, found himself possessed of a singular
freedom. He could refuse any invitation on the grounds of a draft; he could banish any wedding cake on the
grounds of digestion. His eccentricities were indulged by a neighborhood that mistook his selfishness for delicacy. He ruled his household
with a rod of iron wrapped in flannel. To be considered "peculiar" is often the most effective way to secure
one’s own comfort, for the world is generally too polite to argue with a man who is afraid of a
breeze.

23. The Tyranny of Correspondence The obligation to write letters is a chain that binds the absent to the present. A
young lady who leaves home is expected to provide a chronicle of her every movement. She must describe the weather,
the company, and the gowns with a fidelity that rivals a newspaper. To fail in this duty is to be
thought "cold." She sits at her desk, the sun shining outside, laboring over a sheet of crossed lines, a prisoner
of affection. She learns that true independence would be the right to be silent, to let the days pass without
a record, and to keep her observations for herself.

24. The Illusion of the "Season" We speak of the London Season as a time of gaiety, but for the mother
of marriageable daughters, it is a campaign of rigorous discipline. There is no freedom in a ballroom. The young lady
must dance with the bore who asks her; she must smile at the hostess who ignores her. She is on
display, a commodity in white muslin. Her every glance is watched; her every partner is weighed. She is less free
than the scullery maid, who at least owns her own Sunday afternoon. The Season is a market, and the goods
have no voice in the transaction.

25. The Freedom of the Garden The garden is the only kingdom where a woman may reign absolute. Mrs. Norris, having
no children to manage, devoted her energies to the management of her apricots. She pruned; she weeded; she waged war
on the slugs. Her authority was unquestioned. The gardener might grumble, but he obeyed. In the ordering of her flowerbeds,
she found a satisfaction that the ordering of her husband’s dinner never provided. It was a small sovereignty, perhaps, bounded
by a hedge and a wall, but within those limits, she was a queen, and her subjects—the roses—were always grateful.

26. The Independence of the Second Son The second son, having no estate to inherit, is often the architect of his
own fortune. He looks at his elder brother, bound to the land and the tenants, with a pity that is
half sincere. The heir must marry for connection; the cadet may marry for love. The heir must live in the
old house; the cadet may see the world. He enters the navy or the law, finding in the struggle for
advancement a zest that the mere possession of property cannot give. He is the master of his own fate, while
his brother is merely the servant of his ancestors.

27. The Liberty of the Governess The governess occupies a position of unique isolation. She is neither servant nor family. She
sits in the parlor but does not speak; she walks in the garden but does not dine. Her freedom is
the freedom of the ghost—to observe without participating. She sees the quarrels, the flirtations, and the follies of her employers
with a clarity that they themselves lack. She is a spectator of life, and if she has a mind, she
finds a grim amusement in the drama. Her independence is of the spirit, for while her body is hired, her
thoughts remain her own, a secret territory that no employer can invade.

28. The Freedom of the "Unmarriageable" Age There comes a time in the life of a single woman when she ceases
to be "on the market." The day she puts on a cap is the day of her emancipation. She is
no longer required to be "accomplished." She may close the piano forever; she may throw away her paints. She can
talk to a gentleman without being suspected of designs. She can eat a hearty dinner without fear of seeming unrefined.
The world calls her an "old maid," but she calls herself free, having passed through the fire of expectation and
emerged on the other side into the cool, calm air of indifference.

29. The Tyranny of the Dinner Party To dine out is often considered a pleasure, but it is in reality a
surrender of liberty. The guest is bound by the laws of precedence. He must sit next to the person assigned
to him, regardless of their dullness. He must eat what is placed before him, regardless of his appetite. He must
stay until the carriage is announced, regardless of his boredom. The host is a dictator for the evening, and the
guest is a conscript. To refuse an invitation is an insult; to accept is a drudgery. True freedom would be
to dine on a tray in one’s own library, with a book for company and no necessity to make conversation
about the weather.

30. The Ultimate Freedom "A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of." This sentiment, uttered by
a young lady of sense, contains the kernel of the matter. Money buys privacy; money buys silence; money buys the
right to be wrong. The poor are always accountable; the rich are always excused. To possess a fortune is to
possess the keys to the prison of social obligation. One may be rude, eccentric, or foolish, and yet be courted.
It is a cynical truth, perhaps, but one that every person of experience acknowledges: that in a world of rules,
gold is the only exemption.

31. The Bondage of Affection It is a truth often whispered but rarely printed that a marriage of pure affection is
a species of slavery. The young couple who marry on nothing but love find themselves bound by the chains of
the butcher and the baker. They are free from the tyranny of a wealthy parent, perhaps, but they have exchanged
it for the tyranny of a small income. To be obliged to count every candle and to tremble at the
price of coals is a heavy price to pay for the liberty of the heart. Romance is a delightful guest,
but it is a poor provider, and the freedom to starve together is a privilege that few sensible people would
envy.

32. The Slavery of the Lapdog Lady Bertram, possessing every comfort that wealth could buy, was yet the willing slave of
a pug. Her entire day was regulated by the whims of the animal. If the dog slept, the house must
be silent; if the dog walked, the carriage must wait. She believed herself the mistress of Mansfield Park, but in
reality, she was merely the chief lady-in-waiting to a canine despot. It was a servitude disguised as affection, proving that
the human heart, having no serious object, will often construct a prison for itself out of the most trivial materials.

33. The Privacy of the Crowd To be lost in London is a freedom unknown to the village. In the country,
a walk to the post office is a public event. Every eye is a spyglass; every curtain hides a commentator.
But in the metropolis, one may walk for miles without meeting a single acquaintance. The noise of the streets drowns
out the whisper of scandal. A gentleman may wear a shabby coat, or a lady a faded bonnet, with perfect
impunity. This anonymity is the great luxury of the capital, allowing the soul to breathe an air that is not
thickened by the curiosity of neighbors.

34. The Burden of "Accomplishments" The education of a young lady is often a systematic destruction of her leisure. She is
taught to play the harp, to paint screens, and to net purses, not because she enjoys these tasks, but because
she must be "accomplished." She sits at the instrument for hours, a prisoner of practice. Her fingers ache; her mind
wanders. She is working to acquire a value in the marriage market. True independence would be to close the piano
and read a novel, but such a rebellion would be to admit that she has no desire to please, a
confession that no well-bred woman dares to make.

35. The Freedom of the Eccentric Aunt Miss Bates, having no husband to please and no fortune to lose, enjoyed the
peculiar liberty of the garrulous. She could talk for an hour without stopping; she could praise a baked apple as
if it were a diamond. The world laughed at her, but it also tolerated her. She was free from the
necessity of being clever. She lived in a stream of consciousness that flowed unchecked by the dams of social restraint.
Her poverty was her passport; because she wanted nothing, she feared nothing, and found a happiness in her own volubility
that many a silent, wealthy matron might envy.

36. The Independent Purse "A woman must have money of her own," declares the prudent mother. Pin money is the only
true declaration of independence. To be obliged to ask a husband for every guinea is a humiliation that sours the
sweetest temper. It turns a partner into a petitioner. But to open one’s own purse, to pay for a ribbon
or a charity without explanation—this is power. It changes the balance of domestic politics. A wife with a settlement is
a sovereign ally; a wife without one is a subject, and the difference is felt in every conversation at the
breakfast table.

37. The Sanctuary of the Library Mr. Bennet found his freedom in a book. When the noise of his wife’s nerves
or his daughters’ folly became too great, he retreated to his library and shut the door. It was a magic
barrier. Inside, he was a philosopher, conversing with the wits of the past; outside, he was merely a husband and
a father. The library was his citadel. He defended it with a sarcasm that kept intruders at bay. It was
a limited freedom, perhaps, bounded by four walls, but within that space, his mind was his own, and he could
laugh at the world without the trouble of explaining the joke.

38. The Tyranny of the "Morning Call" Social life is a web of obligations, the most irksome of which is the
Morning Call. We must visit people we do not like, to talk about things we do not care about, for
a length of time that is strictly regulated by custom. To stay too long is a bore; to leave too
soon is an insult. We sit on the edge of a chair, balancing a teacup and a conversation, longing for
the moment of release. It is a voluntary imprisonment. We go because "it is done," sacrificing our morning and our
temper on the altar of a politeness that deceives no one.

39. The Trap of the Engagement A long engagement is often praised as a test of constancy, but it is in
reality a suspension of life. The couple is neither married nor free. They are bound by a promise that may
become a burden. They must correspond; they must visit; they must exhibit a devotion that time may have cooled. They
are prisoners of their own word. To break it is dishonor; to keep it is misery. They walk through the
years in a twilight of waiting, envying the freedom of the single and the certainty of the married, while possessing
the advantages of neither.

40. The Philosophy of Contentment "I am very well as I am," says the gentleman who has decided not to marry.
He is the true philosopher. He has weighed the comforts of a wife against the comforts of a quiet life,
and chosen the latter. He is free to dine at his club; he is free to read in bed. He
is not responsible for the happiness of another. The world calls him "selfish," but he calls himself "wise." He has
discovered that the greatest independence is the absence of desire, and that the man who wants nothing from society is
the only man society cannot control.

41. The Tyranny of the Chaperone A young lady of beauty and fortune is never trusted with her own safety. She
is guarded like a state prisoner. She cannot walk across a room without a chaperone; she cannot speak to a
gentleman without a witness. This constant surveillance is called "protection," but to the spirited mind, it feels remarkably like captivity.
The chaperone is a jailer in lace, whose duty is to ensure that the prisoner does not escape into the
dangerous world of unapproved conversation. True independence, for such a girl, is a dream that can only be realized by
exchanging the tyranny of the aunt for the milder, or perhaps stricter, custody of a husband.

42. The Slavery of Debt "A man in debt is so far a slave," says the proverb, and nowhere is this
more true than in the life of a gentleman of fashion. To owe money to a tradesman is to lose
the right to complain of his goods. To owe money to a friend is to lose the right to be
his equal. The debtor walks the streets in fear of a tap on the shoulder. He smiles when he wishes
to frown; he agrees when he wishes to dispute. He has sold his independence for a coat or a carriage,
discovering too late that the livery of the debtor is the heaviest uniform a man can wear.

43. The Freedom of the Watering Place A trip to the seaside offers a suspension of the ordinary laws of society.
At a watering place, the rigid distinctions of rank are softened by the salt air. One may speak to a
stranger in the library without an introduction; one may walk on the sands with a freedom that would be scandalous
in a London park. The pursuit of health provides an excuse for the pursuit of pleasure. It is a temporary
liberty, a carnival of relaxation where the stiffest matron may unbend, and where a young lady may find that the
horizon is wider than the view from her father’s parlor window.

44. The Sanctuary of the Club For the gentleman oppressed by the domestic circle, the Club is the last refuge of
independence. Here, he is safe from the sound of the pianoforte and the complaints of the nursery. He may read
the paper in a silence that is profound and religious. He may dine on a chop without being asked to
carve a goose for ten people. The Club is a monastery without vows, a place where a man may enjoy
the society of his fellows without the necessity of exerting himself to please them, finding in the leather armchair a
throne of solitary power.

45. The Liberty of the "Old" Girl There is a certain age at which an unmarried woman passes from the category
of "disappointment" to that of "institution." When she ceases to be a girl and becomes a "character," she gains a
sudden freedom. She may dress as she pleases, favoring colors that startle the eye. She may express opinions on politics
that would shock a bishop. She is no longer competing for a prize, and so she is no longer bound
by the rules of the contest. She walks through the world with a stride that says she has seen the
folly of men and prefers the company of her cat.

46. The Tyranny of Furniture We imagine we possess our things, but often our things possess us. Mrs. Elton, having furnished
her drawing room with the utmost expense, found herself the slave of her upholstery. She could not admit the sun,
for fear of fading the carpet; she could not admit a dog, for fear of scratching the sofa. She lived
in a twilight of preservation. Her house was a museum, not a home. She sacrificed her comfort to her chintz,
proving that the woman who surrounds herself with delicate objects builds a cage of porcelain and mahogany from which she
dares not escape.

47. The Freedom of the Artist To possess a talent is to possess a secret key to liberty. The young lady
who can lose herself in her sketchbook or her writing desk has a retreat that no one can invade. While
her body is present at the tea table, enduring the gossip of her neighbors, her mind is free, roaming a
landscape of her own creation. She smiles at the bore, but she does not hear him. This mental independence is
the armor of the intellectual, allowing her to live in the world without being of it, and to find a
happiness that does not depend on the precarious favor of society.

48. The Burden of the Great Estate The owner of a great estate is often less the master of the land
than its servant. He is bound to the soil by a thousand duties. He must repair the cottages; he must
settle the disputes of the tenants; he must sit on the bench and dine with the bishop. He cannot travel
without anxiety; he cannot rest without guilt. He is the custodian of a legacy, weighted down by the expectations of
his ancestors and the needs of his dependents. He walks his broad acres not with the joy of possession, but
with the heavy tread of responsibility.

49. The Liberty of the Invalid To be officially "delicate" is to possess a license for selfishness. The invalid may refuse
any invitation that promises boredom. She may demand the most comfortable chair and the choicest cut of meat. She rules
her family with a sigh and a bottle of smelling salts. Her weakness is her strength. She is exempt from
the duties of life, from the fatigue of standing, and from the necessity of being agreeable. She has purchased her
freedom at the price of her health, or perhaps only the appearance of it, finding that a well-timed headache is
the most effective barrier against the intrusions of the world.

50. The Freedom of Silence In a society that values conversation above all else, the person who dares to be silent
is a revolutionary. To sit in a circle of chatter and contribute nothing but a calm smile is an act
of independence. It forces the others to do the work. The silent man or woman remains a mystery, their thoughts
unguessed, their opinions uncompromised. They do not expose themselves to criticism by foolish speech. They hold their peace like a
fortress, proving that the most effective way to maintain one’s liberty is to keep one’s own counsel.

Here is the final batch (51–62) of paragraphs on "Freedom and Independence," concluding our study of liberty and limitation in
the style of Jane Austen.

Batch 6: The Final Liberty 51. The Bondage of "Improvement" To inherit a house is often to inherit a tyrant.
The young heir, full of modern notions, decides to "improve" his estate. He cuts down the avenue of oaks because
it is "gloomy"; he turns the stream because it is "crooked." He becomes the slave of his own plans. He
is bankrupted by his architect and exhausted by his landscape gardener. He believed he was exercising his freedom, but he
was merely following a fashion that will be laughed at by his grandchildren. True independence would be to leave the
moss on the wall and the trees where they stand, but such a neglect of improvement is a courage given
to few.

52. The Freedom of the "Bad" Match Society shudders at the imprudent marriage, but the couple who defies the world often
finds a singular kind of liberty. They are cut by their ambitious relations; they are ignored by the great. In
this isolation, they discover each other. They are free from the necessity of giving dinners they cannot afford. They live
in a cottage that is small but their own. Their poverty is a fortress against the bore. They have exchanged
the approval of the county for the approval of their own hearts, and if they sometimes miss the turtle soup,
they find the bread and cheese of independence has a flavor all its own.

53. The Tyranny of the Will The dead hand of the testator reaches out from the grave to bind the living.
A father leaves his fortune to his son on the condition that he does not marry a certain lady; an
aunt leaves her diamonds to her niece on the condition that she never leaves the parish. To accept the legacy
is to accept the chains. The beneficiary walks in the shadow of a ghost. He is rich, but he is
not free. He learns that money given with conditions is not a gift, but a bribe, and that the only
true inheritance is the one that comes without a codicil attached.

54. The Liberty of the Spinster Aunt The maiden aunt is often the most liberated member of the family circle. She
has no husband to contradict her; she has no children to disappoint her. She arrives for a visit, distributes advice
and peppermints, and departs when the noise becomes excessive. She is a free agent. She may travel to London or
to Bath at her own pleasure. Her affections are diffused among a dozen nephews and nieces, allowing her to enjoy
the pleasures of family without the crushing responsibility of parenthood. She is the ultimate observer, watching the domestic drama from
the best seat in the house, but free to leave at the intermission.

55. The Paradox of the "Smart" Set To belong to the most fashionable circle is a slavery that calls itself exclusivity.
The members of the "Smart Set" are bound by a code more rigid than the laws of the Medes and
Persians. They must dine at a certain hour; they must be seen at a certain opera; they must cut the
people who are "out." They live in terror of doing the wrong thing. Their conversation is a litany of who
is "in" and who is not. They believe themselves the elite of the earth, but they are in reality the
prisoners of their own snobbery, unable to enjoy a simple pleasure for fear it might be vulgar.

56. The Freedom of the Quiet Life "I wish for nothing but to be let alone," says the gentleman who has
retired to his library. This is the ultimate ambition of the philosopher. To withdraw from the noise of the world,
to shut the gate against the morning caller, to read the newspaper without feeling obliged to have an opinion on
it—this is true independence. The world calls it "misanthropy," but the wise man calls it peace. He has discovered that
the only way to be free is to be forgotten, and that obscurity is a cloak that keeps out the
cold wind of public censure.

57. The Tyranny of the "Family Name" To be born a Darcy or a Fitzwilliam is a privilege that carries a
heavy tax. The bearer of a great name is not an individual, but a representative. He must act in a
manner consistent with his ancestors. He cannot marry a woman of low birth without betraying five centuries of history. He
cannot enter a profession that is considered "low." He is the custodian of a reputation that was built by dead
men. He walks through life with the weight of a gallery of portraits on his shoulders, envying the freedom of
the smith who has no name to uphold but his own.

58. The Liberty of the Second Childhood Old age brings with it a certain license that is denied to youth. The
grandmother may say exactly what she thinks. She may be rude to the vicar; she may spoil the grandchildren; she
may wear a cap that is twenty years out of date. The world excuses her "eccentricities" on the grounds of
her years. She has outlived the necessity of pleasing. She sits in her corner, a free spirit in a frail
body, enjoying the spectacle of her descendants struggling with the very conventions she has happily discarded.

59. The Freedom of the Unexpected Legacy To receive a fortune from a distant cousin whom one has never met is
the purest form of luck. It comes without the burden of gratitude or the sorrow of bereavement. It is a
gift from the gods of chance. The recipient is suddenly lifted from the necessity of toil. He can buy the
horse he has coveted; he can marry the girl he loves. For a moment, the world is fluid. He is
the master of his fate. It is a freedom that is as intoxicating as it is rare, proving that while
money cannot buy happiness, it can certainly buy the liberty to pursue it.

60. The Tyranny of "Good Advice" We are surrounded by people who wish to do us good. Friends, relations, and even
strangers are eager to offer their counsel. "You should marry Mr. Collins," says the mother. "You should avoid the militia,"
says the aunt. To listen to them all is to lose one’s own mind. The person who wishes to be
free must learn to nod politely and then do exactly as they please. It requires a certain hardness of heart
to reject the well-meant tyranny of affection, but without it, independence is merely a word in a dictionary.

61. The Final Independence Death is the only state of absolute liberty. The dead are beyond the reach of scandal, of
debt, and of duty. They have paid their last bill and answered their last letter. They sleep in a peace
that the living can only envy. Yet, the wise man seeks to achieve a measure of that freedom while he
still breathes. He cultivates a detachment from the opinion of the world; he limits his wants; he cherishes his friends
and ignores his enemies. He builds a fortress of the mind where he can be, if not a king, at
least a free citizen of his own soul.

62. The Conclusion of Liberty And so we leave the subject of freedom, finding it, like happiness, to be a thing
of shadows and paradoxes. We bind ourselves with laws to be free; we marry to be independent; we work to
be at leisure. The perfect liberty we dream of exists only in novels, where the heroine always marries the man
of her choice and has twenty thousand a year. In the real world, we must be content with the smaller
freedoms: the freedom to choose our own book, to walk in our own garden, and to close our own door
against the intrusion of a world that is always too much with us.
