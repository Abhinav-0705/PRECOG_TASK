Its chest heaving in this frantic, uneven way... made my stomach hurt. I knelt on the stones; they were burning. My shadow covered the lamentable thing. I reached out a finger—then pulled it back. I wanted to help it, but I was terrified. That it might die right when I touched it. As if the life leaving it would rub off on me somehow. I watched it for hours. Stuck between running for my mom and just needing to see what happened next. When it stopped, the backyard seemed different. Sharper, I guess. Not a playground anymore."}
