I remember finding it there, twitching still. Its chest was heaving, frantic and uneven, making my stomach hurt. I knelt on the patio stones—they were burning. My shadow covered the creature. I reached out a finger, then pulled it back. I wanted to help it, but I was terrified, too. That it might expire right when I touched it, as if the life leaving it would... rub off on me somehow. I watched it for hours. Stuck between running for my mom and just needing to see what happened next. When it stopped, the backyard felt different. Sharper, I guess. Not like a playground anymore."}
