At that point, I did not fully understand what the Honors program was, what\nPrecog specifically worked on, or the research areas it focused on. Yet, the way Precog was presented—as a space that values depth, rigor, and exploration of challenging problems—resonated\nstrongly with me.\nMotivated by this initial curiosity, I began learning more about Precog by interacting with\nseniors and exploring the lab’s research themes in detail. As I read about the problems Precog\nfocuses on and its broader research philosophy, my interest became more concrete. I found\nmyself drawn to research that emphasizes understanding, reliability, and reasoning in learningbased systems rather than treating models as opaque black boxes. Through this process, I\nidentified the areas I am most interested in working on in depth: interpretability, natural\nlanguage processing, and robustness.\nOne of the main reasons I wish to work with Precog is its emphasis on interpretability as a core\nresearch objective. As learning-based systems are increasingly deployed in complex and sequential decision-making settings, understanding why a system behaves in a certain way becomes\ncrucial. I am interested in methods that uncover the structure of learned representations, provide insight into decision-making processes, and allow systematic analysis of failures. Precog’s\napproach to interpretability, grounded in reasoning rather than superficial explanations, aligns\nclosely with how I want to approach research.\nI am also interested in natural language processing, particularly beyond conventional textcentric tasks. I am fascinated by the idea of language as a medium for abstraction, instruction,\nand explanation in intelligent systems. I see strong potential in using language to improve\ntransparency and alignment by enabling humans to specify intent, constraints, or reasoning in\na more natural form. This view of NLP as an interface to reasoning and decision-making closely\nmatches Precog’s research direction.\nRobustness forms the third pillar of my interest. Real-world systems must operate under noise,\nuncertainty, and distribution shifts, and I am keen to study how learning-based models behave when assumptions break. I am particularly interested in designing systems that degrade\ngracefully and can be analyzed and debugged under failure. Precog’s focus on robustness as a\nfoundational concern, rather than an afterthought, strongly resonates with my own perspective.\nMy academic and project experiences have trained me to think carefully about problem struc1\nture, assumptions, and edge cases. I am comfortable working with incomplete specifications\nand iteratively refining systems based on observed behavior. Rather than optimizing solely for\nperformance metrics, I focus on understanding underlying mechanisms and failure modes, which\nhas naturally shaped my interest in interpretability and robustness.\nAt Precog, I hope to work on problems that combine interpretability, language, and robustness\nin learning-based decision systems. I am eager to engage deeply with challenging research\nproblems, learn from the group, and contribute meaningfully to Precog’s efforts in building\nintelligent systems that are reliable, interpretable, and grounded in reasoning.\nI believe that I am definitely not the best candidate but will always try to achieve it by my\npersistence, perseverance, and patience towards my goal. Of course, nothing is perfect in\nnature, including nature itself; evolution, for instance, works through countless small failures\nbefore producing something robust enough to survive. But I will always try to improve myself,\nand the only person I will try to compete with is the ME yesterday. If anyone could do better\nthan me today, that will only be ME tomorrow. I focus on improving the process rather than\nworrying too much about anything, because ultimately our output is just the by-product of the\nprocess and efforts we put in."}
