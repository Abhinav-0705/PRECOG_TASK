2,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter1.txt,"You don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain’t no matter. That book was made
by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things
which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I
never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt
Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly—Tom’s Aunt Polly, she
is—and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book,
which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before."
3,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter1.txt,"Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money
that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six
thousand dollars apiece—all gold. It was an awful sight of money when
it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at
interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year
round—more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas
she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was
rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular
and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn’t stand
it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead
again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and
said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I
would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back."
4,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter1.txt,"The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she
called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.
She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn’t do nothing but
sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing
commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come
to time. When you got to the table you couldn’t go right to eating, but
you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a
little over the victuals, though there warn’t really anything the
matter with them,—that is, nothing only everything was cooked by
itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed
up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better."
5,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter1.txt,"After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the
Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but
by-and-by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long
time; so then I didn’t care no more about him, because I don’t take no
stock in dead people."
6,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter1.txt,"Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she
wouldn’t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn’t clean, and I must
try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They
get down on a thing when they don’t know nothing about it. Here she was
a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to
anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for
doing a thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of
course that was all right, because she done it herself."
7,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter1.txt,"Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,
had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a
spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then
the widow made her ease up. I couldn’t stood it much longer. Then for
an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say,
“Don’t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don’t scrunch up like
that, Huckleberry—set up straight;” and pretty soon she would say,
“Don’t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry—why don’t you try to
behave?” Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished
I was there. She got mad then, but I didn’t mean no harm. All I wanted
was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn’t particular.
She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn’t say it for
the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.
Well, I couldn’t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I
made up my mind I wouldn’t try for it. But I never said so, because it
would only make trouble, and wouldn’t do no good."
8,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter1.txt,"Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good
place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all
day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn’t think much
of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer
would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad
about that, because I wanted him and me to be together."
9,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter1.txt,"Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.
By-and-by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then
everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle,
and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and
tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn’t no use. I felt so
lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the
leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away
off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a
dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was
trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn’t make out what it was,
and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods
I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell
about something that’s on its mind and can’t make itself understood,
and so can’t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every
night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some
company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I
flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it
was all shriveled up. I didn’t need anybody to tell me that that was an
awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and
most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my
tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up
a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I
hadn’t no confidence. You do that when you’ve lost a horseshoe that
you’ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn’t ever
heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you’d killed
a spider."
10,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter1.txt,"I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;
for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn’t
know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go
boom—boom—boom—twelve licks; and all still again—stiller than ever.
Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the
trees—something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I
could just barely hear a “_me-yow! me-yow!_” down there. That was good!
Says I, “_me-yow! me-yow!_” as soft as I could, and then I put out the
light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped
down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,
there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me"
11,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter10.txt,CHAPTER X.
12,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter10.txt,"After breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how
he come to be killed, but Jim didn’t want to. He said it would fetch
bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha’nt us; he said a
man that warn’t buried was more likely to go a-ha’nting around than one
that was planted and comfortable. That sounded pretty reasonable, so I
didn’t say no more; but I couldn’t keep from studying over it and
wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for."
13,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter10.txt,"We rummaged the clothes we’d got, and found eight dollars in silver
sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat. Jim said he reckoned
the people in that house stole the coat, because if they’d a knowed the
money was there they wouldn’t a left it. I said I reckoned they killed
him, too; but Jim didn’t want to talk about that. I says:"
14,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter10.txt,"“Now you think it’s bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in
the snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before
yesterday? You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a
snake-skin with my hands. Well, here’s your bad luck! We’ve raked in
all this truck and eight dollars besides. I wish we could have some bad
luck like this every day, Jim.”"
15,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter10.txt,"“Never you mind, honey, never you mind. Don’t you git too peart. It’s
a-comin’. Mind I tell you, it’s a-comin’.”"
16,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter10.txt,"It did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that talk. Well, after
dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the
ridge, and got out of tobacco. I went to the cavern to get some, and
found a rattlesnake in there. I killed him, and curled him up on the
foot of Jim’s blanket, ever so natural, thinking there’d be some fun
when Jim found him there. Well, by night I forgot all about the snake,
and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light
the snake’s mate was there, and bit him."
17,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter10.txt,"He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the
varmint curled up and ready for another spring. I laid him out in a
second with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap’s whisky-jug and begun to pour
it down."
18,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter10.txt,"He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all
comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you
leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. Jim
told me to chop off the snake’s head and throw it away, and then skin
the body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it
would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them
around his wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid out
quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I
warn’t going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could
help it."
19,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter10.txt,"Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his
head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself
he went to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big,
and so did his leg; but by-and-by the drunk begun to come, and so I
judged he was all right; but I’d druther been bit with a snake than
pap’s whisky."
20,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter10.txt,"Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all
gone and he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn’t ever take
a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had
come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And he
said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we
hadn’t got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon
over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a
snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself,
though I’ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left
shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.
Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than
two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread
himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and
they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried
him so, so they say, but I didn’t see it. Pap told me. But anyway it
all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool."
21,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter10.txt,"Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks
again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big
hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as
big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two
hundred pounds. We couldn’t handle him, of course; he would a flung us
into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around
till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round
ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and
there was a spool in it. Jim said he’d had it there a long time, to
coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever
catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn’t ever seen a
bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at the village. They
peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there;
everybody buys some of him; his meat’s as white as snow and makes a
good fry."
22,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter10.txt,"Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a
stirring up some way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and
find out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I must
go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said,
couldn’t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?
That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico
gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it. Jim
hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on the
sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in
and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe. Jim said
nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practiced around
all day to get the hang of the things, and by-and-by I could do pretty
well in them, only Jim said I didn’t walk like a girl; and he said I
must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket. I took
notice, and done better."
23,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter10.txt,I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.
24,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter10.txt,"I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and
the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. I
tied up and started along the bank. There was a light burning in a
little shanty that hadn’t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered
who had took up quarters there. I slipped up and peeped in at the
window. There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a
candle that was on a pine table. I didn’t know her face; she was a
stranger, for you couldn’t start a face in that town that I didn’t
know. Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid
I had come; people might know my voice and find me out. But if this
woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I
wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I
wouldn’t forget I was a girl."
25,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,CHAPTER II.
26,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end
of the widow’s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn’t scrape
our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and
made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson’s big
nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him
pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and
stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:"
27,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,“Who dah?”
28,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right
between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes
and minutes that there warn’t a sound, and we all there so close
together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I
dasn’t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,
right between my shoulders. Seemed like I’d die if I couldn’t scratch.
Well, I’ve noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with the
quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain’t
sleepy—if you are anywheres where it won’t do for you to scratch, why
you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim
says:"
29,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"“Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn’ hear sumf’n.
Well, I know what I’s gwyne to do: I’s gwyne to set down here and
listen tell I hears it agin.”"
30,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up
against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most
touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears
come into my eyes. But I dasn’t scratch. Then it begun to itch on the
inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn’t know how I was going
to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven
minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in
eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn’t stand it more’n a
minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then
Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore—and then I was
pretty soon comfortable again."
31,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"Tom he made a sign to me—kind of a little noise with his mouth—and we
went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom
whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said
no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they’d find out I
warn’t in. Then Tom said he hadn’t got candles enough, and he would
slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn’t want him to try. I said
Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in
there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for
pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing
would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and
knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while,
everything was so still and lonesome."
32,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,
and by-and-by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of
the house. Tom said he slipped Jim’s hat off of his head and hung it on
a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn’t wake.
Afterwards Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance,
and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees
again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time
Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that,
every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by-and-by he
said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and
his back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it,
and he got so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers
would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up
to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with
their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.
Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen
fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about
such things, Jim would happen in and say, “Hm! What you know ’bout
witches?” and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.
Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string,
and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and
told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he
wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was
he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim
anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they
wouldn’t touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it. Jim was
most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having
seen the devil and been rode by witches."
33,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away
down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling,
where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling
ever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile
broad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo
Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the
old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile
and a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore."
34,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the
secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest
part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our
hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave
opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked
under a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole. We
went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and
sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:"
35,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"“Now, we’ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer’s Gang.
Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his
name in blood.”"
36,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had
wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the
band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything
to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person
and his family must do it, and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep till
he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the
sign of the band. And nobody that didn’t belong to the band could use
that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he
must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the
secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt
up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the
list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse
put on it and be forgot forever."
37,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it
out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of
pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had
it."
38,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told
the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote
it in. Then Ben Rogers says:"
39,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"“Here’s Huck Finn, he hain’t got no family; what you going to do ’bout
him?”"
40,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"“Well, hain’t he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer."
41,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"“Yes, he’s got a father, but you can’t never find him these days. He
used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain’t been seen
in these parts for a year or more.”"
42,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they
said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it
wouldn’t be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of
anything to do—everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready
to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss
Watson—they could kill her. Everybody said:"
43,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"“Oh, she’ll do. That’s all right. Huck can come in.”"
44,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,
and I made my mark on the paper."
45,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"“Now,” says Ben Rogers, “what’s the line of business of this Gang?”"
46,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"“Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said."
47,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"“But who are we going to rob?—houses, or cattle, or—”"
48,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"“Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain’t robbery; it’s burglary,”
says Tom Sawyer. “We ain’t burglars. That ain’t no sort of style. We
are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks
on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”"
49,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,“Must we always kill the people?”
50,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"“Oh, certainly. It’s best. Some authorities think different, but mostly
it’s considered best to kill them—except some that you bring to the
cave here, and keep them till they’re ransomed.”"
51,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,“Ransomed? What’s that?”
52,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"“I don’t know. But that’s what they do. I’ve seen it in books; and so
of course that’s what we’ve got to do.”"
53,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,“But how can we do it if we don’t know what it is?”
54,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"“Why, blame it all, we’ve _got_ to do it. Don’t I tell you it’s in the
books? Do you want to go to doing different from what’s in the books,
and get things all muddled up?”"
55,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter2.txt,"“Oh, that’s all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation
are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don’t know how to do it to
them?—that’s the thing _I_ want to get at. Now, what do you _reckon_ it
is?”"

account of my clothes; but the widow she didn’t scold, but only cleaned
off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would
behave a while if I could. Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet
and prayed, but nothing come of it. She told me to pray every day, and
whatever I asked for I would get it. But it warn’t so. I tried it. Once
I got a fish-line, but no hooks. It warn’t any good to me without
hooks. I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I
couldn’t make it work. By-and-by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to try
for me, but she said I was a fool. She never told me why, and I
couldn’t make it out no way."

says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don’t
Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? Why can’t the widow get
back her silver snuffbox that was stole? Why can’t Miss Watson fat up?
No, says I to myself, there ain’t nothing in it. I went and told the
widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for
it was “spiritual gifts.” This was too many for me, but she told me
what she meant—I must help other people, and do everything I could for
other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about
myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. I went out in the
woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn’t see no
advantage about it—except for the other people; so at last I reckoned I
wouldn’t worry about it any more, but just let it go. Sometimes the
widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make
a body’s mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold
and knock it all down again. I judged I could see that there was two
Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the
widow’s Providence, but if Miss Watson’s got him there warn’t no help
for him any more. I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong to
the widow’s if he wanted me, though I couldn’t make out how he was
a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was
so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery."

for me; I didn’t want to see him no more. He used to always whale me
when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take
to the woods most of the time when he was around. Well, about this time
he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so
people said. They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was
just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was
all like pap; but they couldn’t make nothing out of the face, because
it had been in the water so long it warn’t much like a face at all.
They said he was floating on his back in the water. They took him and
buried him on the bank. But I warn’t comfortable long, because I
happened to think of something. I knowed mighty well that a drownded
man don’t float on his back, but on his face. So I knowed, then, that
this warn’t pap, but a woman dressed up in a man’s clothes. So I was
uncomfortable again. I judged the old man would turn up again
by-and-by, though I wished he wouldn’t."
72,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter3.txt,"We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. All
the boys did. We hadn’t robbed nobody, hadn’t killed any people, but
only just pretended. We used to hop out of the woods and go charging
down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market,
but we never hived any of them. Tom Sawyer called the hogs “ingots,”
and he called the turnips and stuff “julery,” and we would go to the
cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had
killed and marked. But I couldn’t see no profit in it. One time Tom
sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a
slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he
said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel
of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow
with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand
“sumter” mules, all loaded down with di’monds, and they didn’t have
only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in
ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things. He
said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready. He never
could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns
all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, and
you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn’t worth a
mouthful of ashes more than what they was before. I didn’t believe we
could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see
the camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the
ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down
the hill. But there warn’t no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn’t no
camels nor no elephants. It warn’t anything but a Sunday-school picnic,
and only a primer-class at that. We busted it up, and chased the
children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts
and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a
hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made us
drop everything and cut."
73,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter3.txt,"I didn’t see no di’monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. He said there was
loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too,
and elephants and things. I said, why couldn’t we see them, then? He
said if I warn’t so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I
would know without asking. He said it was all done by enchantment. He
said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure,
and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had
turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite.
I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the
magicians. Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull."

come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and

it. They don’t think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots,
and belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it—or any
other man.”"

tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di’monds, and fill
it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor’s
daughter from China for you to marry, they’ve got to do it—and they’ve
got to do it before sun-up next morning, too. And more: they’ve got to
waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you
understand.”"

like an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn’t
no use, none of the genies come. So then I judged that all that stuff
was only just one of Tom Sawyer’s lies. I reckoned he believed in the

the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the widow’s
ways, too, and they warn’t so raspy on me. Living in a house and
sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold
weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so
that was a rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so
I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming

a mess you are always making!” The widow put in a good word for me, but
that warn’t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough.
I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and
wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to
be. There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn’t

low-spirited and on the watch-out."

fence. It was funny they hadn’t come in, after standing around so. I
couldn’t make it out. It was very curious, somehow. I was going to

dropped it on the floor. It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an
inch. Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the
same. Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and
listened. But it warn’t no use; he said it wouldn’t talk. He said
sometimes it wouldn’t talk without money. I told him I had an old slick
counterfeit quarter that warn’t no good because the brass showed
through the silver a little, and it wouldn’t pass nohow, even if the
brass didn’t show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that
would tell on it every time. (I reckoned I wouldn’t say nothing about
the dollar I got from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but
maybe the hair-ball would take it, because maybe it wouldn’t know the
difference. Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would
manage so the hair-ball would think it was good. He said he would split
open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it
there all night, and next morning you couldn’t see no brass, and it
wouldn’t feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a

going down town to get some whisky; said he hadn’t had a drink all day.

for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I
reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told

mustn’t interfere and separate families if they could help it; said
he’d druther not take a child away from its father. So Judge Thatcher
and the widow had to quit on the business."
142,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter5.txt,"That pleased the old man till he couldn’t rest. He said he’d cowhide me
till I was black and blue if I didn’t raise some money for him. I
borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got
drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying
on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most
midnight; then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court,
and jailed him again for a week. But he said _he_ was satisfied; said
he was boss of his son, and he’d make it warm for _him_."
143,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter5.txt,"When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him.
So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and
had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was
just old pie to him, so to speak. And after supper he talked to him
about temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he’d
been a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn
over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn’t be ashamed of, and he
hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him. The judge said
he could hug him for them words; so _he_ cried, and his wife she cried
again; pap said he’d been a man that had always been misunderstood
before, and the judge said he believed it. The old man said that what a
man wanted that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so
they cried again. And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held
out his hand, and says:"

There’s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain’t so no more;
it’s the hand of a man that’s started in on a new life, and’ll die
before he’ll go back. You mark them words—don’t forget I said them.
It’s a clean hand now; shake it—don’t be afeard.”"

judge’s wife she kissed it. Then the old man he signed a pledge—made
his mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or
something like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful
room, which was the spare room, and in the night some time he got
powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a
stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb
back again and had a good old time; and towards daylight he crawled out
again, drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left
arm in two places, and was most froze to death when somebody found him
after sun-up. And when they come to look at that spare room they had to
take soundings before they could navigate it."
146,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter5.txt,"The judge he felt kind of sore. He said he reckoned a body could reform
the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn’t know no other way."

148,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter6.txt,"Well, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went
for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he
went for me, too, for not stopping school. He catched me a couple of
times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged
him or outrun him most of the time. I didn’t want to go to school much
before, but I reckoned I’d go now to spite pap. That law trial was a
slow business—appeared like they warn’t ever going to get started on
it; so every now and then I’d borrow two or three dollars off of the
judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every time he got
money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around
town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed. He was just
suited—this kind of thing was right in his line."

last that if he didn’t quit using around there she would make trouble
for him. Well, _wasn’t_ he mad? He said he would show who was Huck
Finn’s boss. So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and
catched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and
crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn’t
no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick
you couldn’t find it if you didn’t know where it was."
150,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter6.txt,"He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off.
We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the
key under his head nights. He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,
and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every little
while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the
ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got
drunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found out where
I was by-and-by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but
pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn’t long after that till I
was used to being where I was, and liked it—all but the cowhide part."
151,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter6.txt,"It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking
and fishing, and no books nor study. Two months or more run along, and
my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn’t see how I’d ever
got to like it so well at the widow’s, where you had to wash, and eat
on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be
forever bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you
all the time. I didn’t want to go back no more. I had stopped cussing,
because the widow didn’t like it; but now I took to it again because
pap hadn’t no objections. It was pretty good times up in the woods
there, take it all around."
152,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter6.txt,"But by-and-by pap got too handy with his hick’ry, and I couldn’t stand
it. I was all over welts. He got to going away so much, too, and
locking me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days. It was
dreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn’t ever
going to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I would fix
up some way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabin many a
time, but I couldn’t find no way. There warn’t a window to it big
enough for a dog to get through. I couldn’t get up the chimbly; it was
too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty careful
not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I
reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I
was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put
in the time. But this time I found something at last; I found an old
rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and
the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was
an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the
cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the
chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the
blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log
out—big enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I
was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap’s gun in the woods.
I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my
saw, and pretty soon pap come in."
153,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter6.txt,"Pap warn’t in a good humor—so he was his natural self. He said he was
down town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned
he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on
the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge
Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there’d be
another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my
guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. This shook me up
considerable, because I didn’t want to go back to the widow’s any more
and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man
got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of,
and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn’t skipped any,
and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round,
including a considerable parcel of people which he didn’t know the
names of, and so called them what’s-his-name when he got to them, and
went right along with his cussing."
154,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter6.txt,"He said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would watch
out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a
place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till
they dropped and they couldn’t find me. That made me pretty uneasy
again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn’t stay on hand till
he got that chance."
155,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter6.txt,"The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got.
There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,
ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two
newspapers for wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went
back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all
over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and
take to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn’t stay in one
place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and
hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man
nor the widow couldn’t ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out
and leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would.
I got so full of it I didn’t notice how long I was staying till the old
man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded."
156,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter6.txt,"I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While
I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of
warmed up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town,
and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body
would a thought he was Adam—he was just all mud. Whenever his liquor
begun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:"
157,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter6.txt,"“Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it’s like.
Here’s the law a-standing ready to take a man’s son away from him—a
man’s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and
all the expense of raising. Yes, just as that man has got that son
raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin’ for
_him_ and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him. And they call
_that_ govment! That ain’t all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge
Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o’ my property. Here’s what
the law does: The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and
up’ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets
him go round in clothes that ain’t fitten for a hog. They call that
govment! A man can’t get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes
I’ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes,
and I _told_ ’em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lots of ’em
heard me, and can tell what I said. Says I, for two cents I’d leave the
blamed country and never come a-near it agin. Them’s the very words. I
says look at my hat—if you call it a hat—but the lid raises up and the
rest of it goes down till it’s below my chin, and then it ain’t rightly
a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o’
stove-pipe. Look at it, says I—such a hat for me to wear—one of the
wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights."
158,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter6.txt,"“Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here.
There was a free nigger there from Ohio—a mulatter, most as white as a
white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the
shiniest hat; and there ain’t a man in that town that’s got as fine
clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a
silver-headed cane—the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. And
what do you think? They said he was a p’fessor in a college, and could
talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. And that ain’t the
wust. They said he could _vote_ when he was at home. Well, that let me
out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? It was ’lection day,
and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn’t too drunk to get
there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where
they’d let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I’ll never vote agin.
Them’s the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may
rot for all me—I’ll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see the
cool way of that nigger—why, he wouldn’t a give me the road if I hadn’t
shoved him out o’ the way. I says to the people, why ain’t this nigger
put up at auction and sold?—that’s what I want to know. And what do you
reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn’t be sold till he’d been in
the State six months, and he hadn’t been there that long yet. There,
now—that’s a specimen. They call that a govment that can’t sell a free
nigger till he’s been in the State six months. Here’s a govment that
calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a
govment, and yet’s got to set stock-still for six whole months before
it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted
free nigger, and—”"
159,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter6.txt,"Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was
taking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and
barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind
of language—mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give
the tub some, too, all along, here and there. He hopped around the
cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding
first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his
left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. But it
warn’t good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of
his toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl
that fairly made a body’s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and
rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over
anything he had ever done previous. He said so his own self afterwards.
He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid
over him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe."
160,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter6.txt,"After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for
two drunks and one delirium tremens. That was always his word. I judged
he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal the
key, or saw myself out, one or t’other. He drank and drank, and tumbled
down on his blankets by-and-by; but luck didn’t run my way. He didn’t
go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned and moaned and thrashed
around this way and that for a long time. At last I got so sleepy I
couldn’t keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed what
I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning."
161,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter6.txt,"I don’t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an
awful scream and I was up. There was pap looking wild, and skipping
around every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was
crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say
one had bit him on the cheek—but I couldn’t see no snakes. He started
and run round and round the cabin, hollering “Take him off! take him
off! he’s biting me on the neck!” I never see a man look so wild in the
eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he
rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way,
and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and
saying there was devils a-hold of him. He wore out by-and-by, and laid
still a while, moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn’t make a sound.
I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it
seemed terrible still. He was laying over by the corner. By-and-by he
raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side. He says,
very low:"

off—they’re cold; let go. Oh, let a poor devil alone!”"
163,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter6.txt,"Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him
alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under
the old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I
could hear him through the blanket."
164,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter6.txt,"By-and-by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he
see me and went for me. He chased me round and round the place with a
clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill
me, and then I couldn’t come for him no more. I begged, and told him I
was only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared and
cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short and dodged
under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my
shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick
as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and
dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a
minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would
sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who."

and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down
the gun. I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then
I laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down
behind it to wait for him to stir. And how slow and still the time did
drag along."

in a minute.”"
175,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"He unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank. I noticed
some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of
bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. I reckoned I would have
great times now if I was over at the town. The June rise used to be
always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes
cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts—sometimes a dozen logs
together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the
wood-yards and the sawmill."
176,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t’other one out
for what the rise might fetch along. Well, all at once here comes a
canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding
high like a duck. I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog,
clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just expected
there’d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that
to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they’d
raise up and laugh at him. But it warn’t so this time. It was a
drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. Thinks
I, the old man will be glad when he sees this—she’s worth ten dollars.
But when I got to shore pap wasn’t in sight yet, and as I was running
her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and
willows, I struck another idea: I judged I’d hide her good, and then,
’stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I’d go down the river
about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a
rough time tramping on foot."
177,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man
coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked
around a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a
piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn’t seen
anything."
178,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"When he got along I was hard at it taking up a “trot” line. He abused
me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and
that was what made me so long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and
then he would be asking questions. We got five catfish off the lines
and went home."

wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap

than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you
see, all kinds of things might happen. Well, I didn’t see no way for a
while, but by-and-by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of

now so nobody won’t think of following me."
182,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"About twelve o’clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The
river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the
rise. By-and-by along comes part of a log raft—nine logs fast together.
We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore. Then we had dinner.
Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch
more stuff; but that warn’t pap’s style. Nine logs was enough for one
time; he must shove right over to town and sell. So he locked me in and
took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.
I judged he wouldn’t come back that night. I waited till I reckoned he
had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that
log again. Before he was t’other side of the river I was out of the
hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder."
183,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid,
and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the
same with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug. I took all the coffee
and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took
the bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and
two blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. I took fish-lines and
matches and other things—everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned
out the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn’t any, only the one out
at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. I fetched
out the gun, and now I was done."
184,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging
out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside
by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and
the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put
two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent
up at that place and didn’t quite touch ground. If you stood four or
five foot away and didn’t know it was sawed, you wouldn’t never notice
it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn’t likely
anybody would go fooling around there."
185,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn’t left a track. I
followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the
river. All safe. So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,
and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon
went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie
farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp."
186,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"I took the axe and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it
considerable a-doing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly
to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down
on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it _was_ ground—hard
packed, and no boards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of
big rocks in it—all I could drag—and I started it from the pig, and
dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and
dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see that
something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was
there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business, and
throw in the fancy touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer
in such a thing as that."
187,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and
stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I took
up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn’t
drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into
the river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag
of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.
I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the
bottom of it with the saw, for there warn’t no knives and forks on the
place—pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking. Then
I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through
the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile
wide and full of rushes—and ducks too, you might say, in the season.
There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that
went miles away, I don’t know where, but it didn’t go to the river. The
meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I
dropped pap’s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done
by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so
it wouldn’t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again."
188,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some
willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I
made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by-and-by laid
down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself,
they’ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then
drag the river for me. And they’ll follow that meal track to the lake
and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers
that killed me and took the things. They won’t ever hunt the river for
anything but my dead carcass. They’ll soon get tired of that, and won’t
bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.
Jackson’s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,
and nobody ever comes there. And then I can paddle over to town nights,
and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson’s Island’s the
place."
189,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When I
woke up I didn’t know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked
around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and
miles across. The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs
that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from
shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.
You know what I mean—I don’t know the words to put it in."
190,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and
start when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon
I made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from
oars working in rowlocks when it’s a still night. I peeped out through
the willow branches, and there it was—a skiff, away across the water. I
couldn’t tell how many was in it. It kept a-coming, and when it was
abreast of me I see there warn’t but one man in it. Think’s I, maybe
it’s pap, though I warn’t expecting him. He dropped below me with the
current, and by-and-by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,
and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.
Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough—and sober, too, by the way he laid his
oars."
191,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"I didn’t lose no time. The next minute I was a-spinning down stream
soft but quick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half,
and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of
the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing,
and people might see me and hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood,
and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float."
192,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking
away into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep when
you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.
And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! I heard people
talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too—every word of
it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short
nights now. T’other one said _this_ warn’t one of the short ones, he
reckoned—and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they
laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and
laughed, but he didn’t laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said
let him alone. The first fellow said he ’lowed to tell it to his old
woman—she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn’t
nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it
was nearly three o’clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn’t wait more than
about a week longer. After that the talk got further and further away,
and I couldn’t make out the words any more; but I could hear the
mumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off."
193,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson’s
Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and
standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid,
like a steamboat without any lights. There warn’t any signs of the bar
at the head—it was all under water now."
194,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"It didn’t take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a ripping
rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and
landed on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into a
deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow
branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe
from the outside."
195,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked
out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,
three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. A
monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along
down, with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched it come creeping
down, and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say,
“Stern oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!” I heard that just as
plain as if the man was by my side."
196,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter7.txt,"There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods,
and laid down for a nap before breakfast"
197,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,CHAPTER VIII.
198,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"The sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight
o’clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about
things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I
could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees
all about, and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places
on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the
freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little
breeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me
very friendly."
199,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"I was powerful lazy and comfortable—didn’t want to get up and cook
breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep
sound of “boom!” away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbow
and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped up, and went and
looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying
on the water a long ways up—about abreast the ferry. And there was the
ferry-boat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the
matter now. “Boom!” I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferry-boat’s
side. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my
carcass come to the top."
200,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"I was pretty hungry, but it warn’t going to do for me to start a fire,
because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the
cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there,
and it always looks pretty on a summer morning—so I was having a good
enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to
eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in
loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the
drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I’ll keep a lookout, and
if any of them’s floating around after me I’ll give them a show. I
changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could
have, and I warn’t disappointed. A big double loaf come along, and I
most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out
further. Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the
shore—I knowed enough for that. But by-and-by along comes another one,
and this time I won. I took out the plug and shook out the little dab
of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was “baker’s bread”—what the
quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone."
201,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching
the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And
then something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson
or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone
and done it. So there ain’t no doubt but there is something in that
thing—that is, there’s something in it when a body like the widow or
the parson prays, but it don’t work for me, and I reckon it don’t work
for only just the right kind."
202,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The
ferry-boat was floating with the current, and I allowed I’d have a
chance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would
come in close, where the bread did. When she’d got pretty well along
down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the
bread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.
Where the log forked I could peep through."
203,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"By-and-by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could a
run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat. Pap,
and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom Sawyer,
and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more. Everybody
was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and says:"
204,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"“Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he’s
washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water’s edge. I
hope so, anyway.”"
205,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"I didn’t hope so. They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly
in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I could see
them first-rate, but they couldn’t see me. Then the captain sung out:"
206,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"“Stand away!” and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that
it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke,
and I judged I was gone. If they’d a had some bullets in, I reckon
they’d a got the corpse they was after. Well, I see I warn’t hurt,
thanks to goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around
the shoulder of the island. I could hear the booming now and then,
further and further off, and by-and-by, after an hour, I didn’t hear it
no more. The island was three mile long. I judged they had got to the
foot, and was giving it up. But they didn’t yet a while. They turned
around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the
Missouri side, under steam, and booming once in a while as they went. I
crossed over to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the
head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri
shore and went home to the town."
207,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after
me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the
thick woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my
things under so the rain couldn’t get at them. I catched a catfish and
haggled him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp
fire and had supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for
breakfast."
208,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well
satisfied; but by-and-by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set
on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the
stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;
there ain’t no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you
can’t stay so, you soon get over it."
209,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"And so for three days and nights. No difference—just the same thing.
But the next day I went exploring around down through the island. I was
boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know all
about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found plenty
strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green
razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. They
would all come handy by-and-by, I judged."
210,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn’t far
from the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn’t shot
nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh
home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and
it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it,
trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I
bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking."
211,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look
further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as
fast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the
thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn’t hear
nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;
and so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod
on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of
my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too."
212,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"When I got to camp I warn’t feeling very brash, there warn’t much sand
in my craw; but I says, this ain’t no time to be fooling around. So I
got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,
and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an
old last year’s camp, and then clumb a tree."
213,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn’t see nothing, I
didn’t hear nothing—I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a
thousand things. Well, I couldn’t stay up there forever; so at last I
got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the
time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from
breakfast."
214,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good and
dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the
Illinois bank—about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and
cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all
night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says to
myself, horses coming; and next I hear people’s voices. I got
everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping
through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn’t got far when I
hear a man say:"
215,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"“We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about
beat out. Let’s look around.”"
216,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"I didn’t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the
old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe."
217,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"I didn’t sleep much. I couldn’t, somehow, for thinking. And every time
I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn’t
do me no good. By-and-by I says to myself, I can’t live this way; I’m
a-going to find out who it is that’s here on the island with me; I’ll
find it out or bust. Well, I felt better right off."
218,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and
then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was
shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day. I
poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound
asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island. A
little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as
saying the night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and
brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the
edge of the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked out through
the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to
blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the
treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped
off towards where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every
minute or two to listen. But I hadn’t no luck somehow; I couldn’t seem
to find the place. But by-and-by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of
fire away through the trees. I went for it, cautious and slow.
By-and-by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on
the ground. It most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his
head, and his head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump
of bushes, in about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It
was getting gray daylight now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched
himself and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson’s Jim! I bet I
was glad to see him. I says:"

220,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter8.txt,"He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his knees,
and puts his hands together and says:"

there and looked at me; never said nothing. Then I says:"

285,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island
that I’d found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,
because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile
wide."
286,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot
high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep
and the bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and
by-and-by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on
the side towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms
bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it. It was cool in
there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we
didn’t want to be climbing up and down there all the time."
287,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps
in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the
island, and they would never find us without dogs. And, besides, he
said them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want
the things to get wet?"
288,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,
and lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by
to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off
of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner."
289,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one
side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a
good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner."
290,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in
there. We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.
Pretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the
birds was right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like
all fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of these
regular summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all
blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so
thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and
here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn
up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a
gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as
if they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and
blackest—_fst!_ it was as bright as glory, and you’d have a little
glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,
hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again
in a second, and now you’d hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,
and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the
under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs—where
it’s long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know."
291,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"“Jim, this is nice,” I says. “I wouldn’t want to be nowhere else but
here. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.”"
292,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"“Well, you wouldn’t a ben here ’f it hadn’t a ben for Jim. You’d a ben
down dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn’ mos’ drownded, too;
dat you would, honey. Chickens knows when it’s gwyne to rain, en so do
de birds, chile.”"
293,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at
last it was over the banks. The water was three or four foot deep on
the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. On that side
it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same
old distance across—a half a mile—because the Missouri shore was just a
wall of high bluffs."
294,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty
cool and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.
We went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines
hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every
old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things;
and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame,
on account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your
hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles—they
would slide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was in was full of
them. We could a had pets enough if we’d wanted them."
295,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft—nice pine
planks. It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long,
and the top stood above water six or seven inches—a solid, level floor.
We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them
go; we didn’t show ourselves in daylight."
296,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before
daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side. She was a
two-story, and tilted over considerable. We paddled out and got
aboard—clumb in at an upstairs window. But it was too dark to see yet,
so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight."
297,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then
we looked in at the window. We could make out a bed, and a table, and
two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there
was clothes hanging against the wall. There was something laying on the
floor in the far corner that looked like a man. So Jim says:"
298,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"“Hello, you!”"
299,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"But it didn’t budge. So I hollered again, and then Jim says:"
300,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,“De man ain’t asleep—he’s dead. You hold still—I’ll go en see.”
301,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"He went, and bent down and looked, and says:"
302,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"“It’s a dead man. Yes, indeedy; naked, too. He’s ben shot in de back. I
reck’n he’s ben dead two er three days. Come in, Huck, but doan’ look
at his face—it’s too gashly.”"
303,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"I didn’t look at him at all. Jim throwed some old rags over him, but he
needn’t done it; I didn’t want to see him. There was heaps of old
greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,
and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls
was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.
There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some
women’s underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men’s clothing,
too. We put the lot into the canoe—it might come good. There was a
boy’s old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too. And there
was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a
baby to suck. We would a took the bottle, but it was broke. There was a
seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke. They
stood open, but there warn’t nothing left in them that was any account.
The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a
hurry, and warn’t fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff."
304,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and
a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of
tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and
a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins
and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a
hatchet and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger
with some monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather
dog-collar, and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn’t
have no label on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable
good curry-comb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden
leg. The straps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good
enough leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim,
and we couldn’t find the other one, though we hunted all around."
305,mark_twain,mark_twain/huckkleberry_finn/chapter9.txt,"And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was ready to
shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was
pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with
the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a
good ways off. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down
most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the bank,
and hadn’t no accidents and didn’t see nobody. We got home all safe"

The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and
disappeared over it."

laugh."

enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old
fools is the biggest fools there is. Can’t learn an old dog new tricks,
as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,
and how is a body to know what’s coming? He ’pears to know just how long
he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make
out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it’s all down again and
I can’t hit him a lick. I ain’t doing my duty by that boy, and that’s
the Lord’s truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as
the Good Book says. I’m a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I
know. He’s full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he’s my own dead
sister’s boy, poor thing, and I ain’t got the heart to lash him,
somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and
every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is
born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says,
and I reckon it’s so. He’ll play hookey this evening,[*] and I’ll just
be obleeged to make him work, tomorrow, to punish him. It’s mighty hard
to make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he
hates work more than he hates anything else, and I’ve _got_ to do some
of my duty by him, or I’ll be the ruination of the child.”"

barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day’s wood
and split the kindlings before supper—at least he was there in time
to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.
Tom’s younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through
with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,
and had no adventurous, trouble-some ways."

offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and
very deep—for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like
many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she
was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she
loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low
cunning. Said she:"

searched Aunt Polly’s face, but it told him nothing. So he said:"

340,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom’s shirt, and said:"

that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing
that that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew
where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:"

343,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of
circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new
inspiration:"

pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!”"
345,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"The trouble vanished out of Tom’s face. He opened his jacket. His shirt
collar was securely sewed."

and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you’re a kind of a
singed cat, as the saying is—better’n you look. _This_ time.”"

had stumbled into obedient conduct for once."

but it’s black.”"

353,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into
the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them—one needle
carried white thread and the other black. He said:"

she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to
gee-miny she’d stick to one or t’other—I can’t keep the run of ’em. But
I bet you I’ll lam Sid for that. I’ll learn him!”"
355,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well
though—and loathed him."
356,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not
because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a
man’s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore
them down and drove them out of his mind for the time—just as men’s
misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new
interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired
from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. It
consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,
produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short
intervals in the midst of the music—the reader probably remembers how to
do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him
the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of
harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer
feels who has discovered a new planet—no doubt, as far as strong, deep,
unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the
astronomer."
357,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom
checked his whistle. A stranger was before him—a boy a shade larger
than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an impressive
curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy
was well dressed, too—well dressed on a week-day. This was simply
astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth
roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes
on—and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of
ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom’s vitals. The
more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose
at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to
him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved—but only
sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the
time. Finally Tom said:"
358,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“I can lick you!”
359,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“I’d like to see you try it.”

367,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“Can’t!”
368,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:

374,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“Much—much—_much_. There now.”
375,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"“Oh, you think you’re mighty smart, _don’t_ you? I could lick you with
one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.”"
376,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“Well why don’t you _do_ it? You _say_ you can do it.”
377,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"“Well I _will_, if you fool with me.”"
378,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“Oh yes—I’ve seen whole families in the same fix.”
379,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"“Smarty! You think you’re _some_, now, _don’t_ you? Oh, what a hat!”"
380,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"“You can lump that hat if you don’t like it. I dare you to knock it
off—and anybody that’ll take a dare will suck eggs.”"
381,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“You’re a liar!”
382,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“You’re another.”
383,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“You’re a fighting liar and dasn’t take it up.”
384,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“Aw—take a walk!”
385,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"“Say—if you give me much more of your sass I’ll take and bounce a rock
off’n your head.”"
386,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"“Oh, of _course_ you will.”"
387,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“Well I _will_.”
388,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"“Well why don’t you _do_ it then? What do you keep _saying_ you will
for? Why don’t you _do_ it? It’s because you’re afraid.”"
389,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“I _ain’t_ afraid.”
390,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“You are.”
391,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“I ain’t.”
392,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“You are.”
393,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently
they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:"
394,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“Get away from here!”
395,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“Go away yourself!”
396,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“I won’t.”
397,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“I won’t either.”
398,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both
shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But
neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and
flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:"
399,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"“You’re a coward and a pup. I’ll tell my big brother on you, and he can
thrash you with his little finger, and I’ll make him do it, too.”"
400,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"“What do I care for your big brother? I’ve got a brother that’s bigger
than he is—and what’s more, he can throw him over that fence, too.”
 [Both brothers were imaginary.]"
401,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“That’s a lie.”
402,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“_Your_ saying so don’t make it so.”
403,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:"
404,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"“I dare you to step over that, and I’ll lick you till you can’t stand
up. Anybody that’ll take a dare will steal sheep.”"
405,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:"
406,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"“Now you said you’d do it, now let’s see you do it.”"
407,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“Don’t you crowd me now; you better look out.”
408,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"“Well, you _said_ you’d do it—why don’t you do it?”"
409,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“By jingo! for two cents I _will_ do it.”
410,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out
with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys
were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and
for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other’s hair and
clothes, punched and scratched each other’s nose, and covered themselves
with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the
fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him
with his fists. “Holler ’nuff!” said he."
411,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying—mainly from rage.
412,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,“Holler ’nuff!”—and the pounding went on.
413,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"At last the stranger got out a smothered “’Nuff!” and Tom let him up and
said:"
414,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"“Now that’ll learn you. Better look out who you’re fooling with next
time.”"
415,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,
snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
threatening what he would do to Tom the “next time he caught him out.”
 To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and
as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it
and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like
an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he
lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the
enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the
window and declined. At last the enemy’s mother appeared, and called Tom
a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but
he said he “’lowed” to “lay” for that boy."
416,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter1.txt,"He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in
at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and
when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his
Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its
firmness."
417,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,CHAPTER X
418,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"The two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with
horror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,
apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump
that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them
catch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay
near the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give
wings to their feet."
419,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!” whispered
Tom, in short catches between breaths. “I can’t stand it much longer.”"
420,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"Huckleberry’s hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed
their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.
They gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst
through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering
shadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:"
421,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Huckleberry, what do you reckon’ll come of this?”"
422,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging’ll come of it.”"

425,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"Tom thought a while, then he said:"

427,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“What are you talking about? S’pose something happened and Injun Joe
_didn’t_ hang? Why, he’d kill us some time or other, just as dead sure
as we’re a laying here.”"

429,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he’s fool enough. He’s
generally drunk enough.”"
430,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,Tom said nothing—went on thinking. Presently he whispered:
431,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Huck, Muff Potter don’t know it. How can he tell?”"
432,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,“What’s the reason he don’t know it?”
433,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Because he’d just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D’you reckon
he could see anything? D’you reckon he knowed anything?”"
434,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“By hokey, that’s so, Tom!”"
435,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“And besides, look-a-here—maybe that whack done for _him_!”"
436,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“No, ’taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and
besides, he always has. Well, when pap’s full, you might take and belt
him over the head with a church and you couldn’t phase him. He says so,
his own self. So it’s the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man
was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.”"
437,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"After another reflective silence, Tom said:"
438,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?”"
439,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Tom, we _got_ to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn’t
make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak
’bout this and they didn’t hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take
and swear to one another—that’s what we got to do—swear to keep mum.”"
440,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“I’m agreed. It’s the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear
that we—”"
441,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Oh no, that wouldn’t do for this. That’s good enough for little
rubbishy common things—specially with gals, cuz _they_ go back on you
anyway, and blab if they get in a huff—but there orter be writing ’bout
a big thing like this. And blood.”"
442,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"Tom’s whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful;
the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it.
He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a
little fragment of “red keel” out of his pocket, got the moon on
his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow
down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the
pressure on the up-strokes."
443,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and
 They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell
 and Rot.”"
444,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom’s facility in writing, and
the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and
was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:"
445,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Hold on! Don’t do that. A pin’s brass. It might have verdigrease on
it.”"
446,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,“What’s verdigrease?”
447,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“It’s p’ison. That’s what it is. You just swaller some of it once—you’ll
see.”"
448,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked
the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after
many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his
little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and
an F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the
wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters
that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown
away."
449,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined
building, now, but they did not notice it."
450,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Tom,” whispered Huckleberry, “does this keep us from _ever_
telling—_always_?”"
451,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Of course it does. It don’t make any difference _what_ happens, we got
to keep mum. We’d drop down dead—don’t _you_ know that?”"

453,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up
a long, lugubrious howl just outside—within ten feet of them. The boys
clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright."

Harbison.” *"

him as “Harbison’s Bull,” but a son or a dog of that name was “Bull
Harbison.”]"

anything it was a _stray_ dog.”"

Tom!”"
464,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His
whisper was hardly audible when he said:"

where _I’ll_ go to. I been so wicked.”"
469,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a
feller’s told _not_ to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I’d a
tried—but no, I wouldn’t, of course. But if ever I get off this time,
I lay I’ll just _waller_ in Sunday-schools!” And Tom began to snuffle a
little."
470,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“_You_ bad!” and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. “Consound it, Tom
Sawyer, you’re just old pie, ’long-side o’ what I am. Oh, _lordy_,
lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.”"
471,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,Tom choked off and whispered:

475,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you
know. _Now_ who can he mean?”"
476,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.
477,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,“Sh! What’s that?” he whispered.
478,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Sounds like—like hogs grunting. No—it’s somebody snoring, Tom.”"

480,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“I bleeve it’s down at ’tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep
there, sometimes, ’long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts
things when _he_ snores. Besides, I reckon he ain’t ever coming back to
this town any more.”"
481,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,The spirit of adventure rose in the boys’ souls once more.
482,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Hucky, do you das’t to go if I lead?”"
483,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“I don’t like to, much. Tom, s’pose it’s Injun Joe!”"
484,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"Tom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the
boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their
heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down,
the one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the
snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man
moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was
Muff Potter. The boys’ hearts had stood still, and their hopes too,
when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tip-toed out,
through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance
to exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night
air again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few
feet of where Potter was lying, and _facing_ Potter, with his nose
pointing heavenward."
485,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Oh, geeminy, it’s _him_!” exclaimed both boys, in a breath."
486,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Say, Tom—they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller’s
house, ’bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come
in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there
ain’t anybody dead there yet.”"
487,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Well, I know that. And suppose there ain’t. Didn’t Gracie Miller fall
in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?”"
488,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“Yes, but she ain’t _dead_. And what’s more, she’s getting better, too.”"
489,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"“All right, you wait and see. She’s a goner, just as dead sure as Muff
Potter’s a goner. That’s what the niggers say, and they know all about
these kind of things, Huck.”"
490,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window
the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and
fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He
was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for
an hour."
491,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the
light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not
been called—persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled
him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs,
feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had
finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted
eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill
to the culprit’s heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it
was up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into
silence and let his heart sink down to the depths."
492,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in
the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt
wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so;
and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs
with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more.
This was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom’s heart was sorer now
than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform
over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that
he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble
confidence."
493,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,"He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward
Sid; and so the latter’s prompt retreat through the back gate was
unnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,
along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the
air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to
trifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his
desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony
stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.
His elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time
he slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with
a sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal
sigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!"
494,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter10.txt,This final feather broke the camel’s back.
495,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,CHAPTER XI
496,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"Close upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified
with the ghastly news. No need of the as yet un-dreamed-of telegraph;
the tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house,
with little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave
holiday for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of
him if he had not."
497,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been
recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter—so the story ran. And
it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself
in the “branch” about one or two o’clock in the morning, and that Potter
had at once sneaked off—suspicious circumstances, especially the washing
which was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town had
been ransacked for this “murderer” (the public are not slow in the
matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he
could not be found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every
direction, and the Sheriff “was confident” that he would be captured
before night."
498,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"All the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom’s heartbreak
vanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not
a thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,
unaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he
wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle.
It seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody pinched
his arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry’s. Then both looked
elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their
mutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly
spectacle before them."
499,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"“Poor fellow!” “Poor young fellow!” “This ought to be a lesson to grave
robbers!” “Muff Potter’ll hang for this if they catch him!” This was the
drift of remark; and the minister said, “It was a judgment; His hand is
here.”"
500,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"Now Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid
face of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,
and voices shouted, “It’s him! it’s him! he’s coming himself!”"
501,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,“Who? Who?” from twenty voices.
502,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,“Muff Potter!”
503,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"“Hallo, he’s stopped!—Look out, he’s turning! Don’t let him get away!”"
504,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"People in the branches of the trees over Tom’s head said he wasn’t
trying to get away—he only looked doubtful and perplexed."
505,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"“Infernal impudence!” said a bystander; “wanted to come and take a quiet
look at his work, I reckon—didn’t expect any company.”"
506,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"The crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously
leading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow’s face was haggard, and
his eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the
murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands
and burst into tears."
507,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"“I didn’t do it, friends,” he sobbed; “’pon my word and honor I never
done it.”"
508,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,“Who’s accused you?” shouted a voice.
509,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"This shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around
him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and
exclaimed:"
510,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"“Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you’d never—”"
511,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,“Is that your knife?” and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.
512,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the
ground. Then he said:"
513,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"“Something told me ’t if I didn’t come back and get—” He shuddered; then
waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, “Tell ’em,
Joe, tell ’em—it ain’t any use any more.”"
514,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the
stony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every
moment that the clear sky would deliver God’s lightnings upon his head,
and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had
finished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to
break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner’s life faded and
vanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and
it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that."
515,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"“Why didn’t you leave? What did you want to come here for?” somebody
said."
516,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"“I couldn’t help it—I couldn’t help it,” Potter moaned. “I wanted to
run away, but I couldn’t seem to come anywhere but here.” And he fell to
sobbing again."
517,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"Injun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes
afterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the
lightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that
Joe had sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the most
balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could
not take their fascinated eyes from his face."
518,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"They inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should
offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master."
519,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in
a wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering
crowd that the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy
circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were
disappointed, for more than one villager remarked:"
520,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,“It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.”
521,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"Tom’s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as
much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:"
522,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"“Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me
awake half the time.”"
523,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.
524,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"“It’s a bad sign,” said Aunt Polly, gravely. “What you got on your mind,
Tom?”"
525,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"“Nothing. Nothing ’t I know of.” But the boy’s hand shook so that he
spilled his coffee."
526,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"“And you do talk such stuff,” Sid said. “Last night you said, ‘It’s
blood, it’s blood, that’s what it is!’ You said that over and over.
And you said, ‘Don’t torment me so—I’ll tell!’ Tell _what_? What is it
you’ll tell?”"
527,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have
happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly’s face
and she came to Tom’s relief without knowing it. She said:"
528,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"“Sho! It’s that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night
myself. Sometimes I dream it’s me that done it.”"
529,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied.
Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after
that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every
night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently
slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good
while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place
again. Tom’s distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew
irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of
Tom’s disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself."
530,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding
inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind.
Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries,
though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises;
he noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness—and that was strange;
and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion
to these inquests, and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled,
but said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and
ceased to torture Tom’s conscience."
531,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his
opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such
small comforts through to the “murderer” as he could get hold of. The
jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge
of the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it
was seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom’s
conscience."
532,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter11.txt,"The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride
him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character
that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the
matter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of his
inquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery
that preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in
the courts at present."
533,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter12.txt,CHAPTER XII
534,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter12.txt,"One of the reasons why Tom’s mind had drifted away from its secret
troubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest
itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had
struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to “whistle her down the
wind,” but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father’s
house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she
should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an
interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there
was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;
there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to
try all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who
are infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of
producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in
these things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a
fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing,
but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the
“Health” periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance
they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the “rot” they
contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up,
and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and
what frame of mind to keep one’s self in, and what sort of clothing
to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her
health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they
had recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest
as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered
together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed
with death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with
“hell following after.” But she never suspected that she was not an
angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering
neighbors."
535,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter12.txt,"The water treatment was new, now, and Tom’s low condition was a windfall
to her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the
wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed
him down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she
rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she
sweated his soul clean and “the yellow stains of it came through his
pores”—as Tom said."
536,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter12.txt,"Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and
pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and
plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the
water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his
capacity as she would a jug’s, and filled him up every day with quack
cure-alls."
537,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter12.txt,"Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase
filled the old lady’s heart with consternation. This indifference must
be broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first
time. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with
gratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water
treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer.
She gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the
result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again;
for the “indifference” was broken up. The boy could not have shown a
wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him."
538,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter12.txt,"Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be
romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have
too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he
thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of
professing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he
became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and
quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings
to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle
clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it
did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in
the sitting-room floor with it."
539,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter12.txt,"One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt’s yellow
cat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging
for a taste. Tom said:"

541,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter12.txt,But Peter signified that he did want it.
542,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter12.txt,“You better make sure.”

544,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter12.txt,"“Now you’ve asked for it, and I’ll give it to you, because there ain’t
anything mean about me; but if you find you don’t like it, you mustn’t
blame anybody but your own self.”"
545,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter12.txt,"Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down
the Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then
delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging
against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next
he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment,
with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his
unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again
spreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time
to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah,
and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots
with him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over
her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter."

549,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter12.txt,"“Deed I don’t know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they’re having a
good time.”"

by anxiety. Too late he divined her “drift.” The handle of the telltale
tea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it
up. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual
handle—his ear—and cracked his head soundly with her thimble."

roasted his bowels out of him ’thout any more feeling than if he was a
human!”"
559,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter12.txt,"Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in
a new light; what was cruelty to a cat _might_ be cruelty to a boy, too.
She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she
put her hand on Tom’s head and said gently:"
560,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter12.txt,"“I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it _did_ do you good.”"

through his gravity."

done _him_ good, too. I never see him get around so since—”"

and see if you can’t be a good boy, for once, and you needn’t take any
more medicine.”"
564,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter12.txt,"Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing
had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late,
he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his
comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to
be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking—down the road.
Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom’s face lighted; he gazed
a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom
accosted him; and “led up” warily to opportunities for remark about
Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and
watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the
owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks
ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered
the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed
in at the gate, and Tom’s heart gave a great bound. The next instant he
was out, and “going on” like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys,
jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings,
standing on his head—doing all the heroic things he could conceive of,
and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher
was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never
looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there?
He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping
around, snatched a boy’s cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse,
broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and
fell sprawling, himself, under Becky’s nose, almost upsetting her—and
she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: “Mf! some
people think they’re mighty smart—always showing off!”"
565,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter12.txt,"Tom’s cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and
crestfallen"

567,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"Tom’s mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a
forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out
what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried
to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing
would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame
_him_ for the consequences—why shouldn’t they? What right had the
friendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would
lead a life of crime. There was no choice."
568,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to
“take up” tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he
should never, never hear that old familiar sound any more—it was very
hard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold
world, he must submit—but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick and
fast."
569,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"Just at this point he met his soul’s sworn comrade, Joe
Harper—hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his
heart. Plainly here were “two souls with but a single thought.” Tom,
wiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about
a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by
roaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping
that Joe would not forget him."
570,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going
to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother
had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and
knew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished
him to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but
succumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her
poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die."
571,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand
by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved
them of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for
being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying,
some time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he
conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of
crime, and so he consented to be a pirate."
572,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River
was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island,
with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a
rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further
shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson’s
Island was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a
matter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn,
and he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was
indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the
river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour—which was
midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture.
Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal
in the most dark and mysterious way—as became outlaws. And before the
afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of
spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would “hear something.” All
who got this vague hint were cautioned to “be mum and wait.”"
573,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,
and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the
meeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay
like an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the
quiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under
the bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the
same way. Then a guarded voice said:"
574,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,“Who goes there?”
575,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"“Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.”"
576,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"“Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.” Tom
had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature."

578,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the
brooding night:"
579,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,“_Blood_!”
580,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,
tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was
an easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked
the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate."
581,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn
himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a
skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought
a few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or
“chewed” but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it
would never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought;
matches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering
upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily
thither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing
adventure of it, saying, “Hist!” every now and then, and suddenly
halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts;
and giving orders in dismal whispers that if “the foe” stirred, to “let
him have it to the hilt,” because “dead men tell no tales.” They knew
well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying
in stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their
conducting this thing in an unpiratical way."
582,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and
Joe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded
arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:"
583,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"“Luff, and bring her to the wind!”"
584,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"“Aye-aye, sir!”"

588,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"“Point it is, sir!”"
589,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream
it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for
“style,” and were not intended to mean anything in particular."
590,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,“What sail’s she carrying?”
591,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"“Courses, tops’ls, and flying-jib, sir.”"

598,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head
right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was
not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during
the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before
the distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay,
peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water,
unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black
Avenger stood still with folded arms, “looking his last” upon the scene
of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing “she” could see
him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless
heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but
a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson’s Island beyond
eye-shot of the village, and so he “looked his last” with a broken and
satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and
they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift
them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in
time, and made shift to avert it. About two o’clock in the morning the
raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,
and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part
of the little raft’s belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they
spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions;
but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as
became outlaws."
599,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps
within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in
the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn “pone” stock
they had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild,
free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,
far from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to
civilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy
glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the
varnished foliage and festooning vines."
600,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance
of corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,
filled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but
they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting
campfire."
601,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,“_Ain’t_ it gay?” said Joe.
602,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,“It’s _nuts_!” said Tom. “What would the boys say if they could see us?”
603,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"“Say? Well, they’d just die to be here—hey, Hucky!”"
604,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"“I reckon so,” said Huckleberry; “anyways, I’m suited. I don’t want
nothing better’n this. I don’t ever get enough to eat, gen’ally—and here
they can’t come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.”"
605,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"“It’s just the life for me,” said Tom. “You don’t have to get up,
mornings, and you don’t have to go to school, and wash, and all that
blame foolishness. You see a pirate don’t have to do _anything_, Joe,
when he’s ashore, but a hermit _he_ has to be praying considerable, and
then he don’t have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.”"
606,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"“Oh yes, that’s so,” said Joe, “but I hadn’t thought much about it, you
know. I’d a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I’ve tried it.”"
607,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"“You see,” said Tom, “people don’t go much on hermits, nowadays, like
they used to in old times, but a pirate’s always respected. And
a hermit’s got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put
sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and—”"

609,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"“I dono. But they’ve _got_ to do it. Hermits always do. You’d have to do
that if you was a hermit.”"

a disgrace.”"
616,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished
gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with
tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of
fragrant smoke—he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The
other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to
acquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:"

and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships—make ’em walk a
plank.”"
620,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"“And they carry the women to the island,” said Joe; “they don’t kill the
women.”"
621,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"“No,” assented Tom, “they don’t kill the women—they’re too noble. And
the women’s always beautiful, too.”"

and di’monds,” said Joe, with enthusiasm."

626,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"“I reckon I ain’t dressed fitten for a pirate,” said he, with a
regretful pathos in his voice; “but I ain’t got none but these.”"
627,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,
after they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand
that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for
wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe."
628,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter13.txt,"Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the
eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the
Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.
The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had
more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly,
and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them
kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at
all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they
might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at
once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep—but an
intruder came, now, that would not “down.” It was conscience. They began
to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and
next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came.
They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had
purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not
to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the
end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking
sweetmeats was only “hooking,” while taking bacon and hams and such
valuables was plain simple stealing—and there was a command against that
in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in
the business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the
crime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously
inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep"
629,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,CHAPTER XIV
630,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"When Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and
rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool
gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the
deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not
a sound obtruded upon great Nature’s meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood
upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire,
and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck
still slept."
631,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently
the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray
of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life
manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going
to work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came
crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air
from time to time and “sniffing around,” then proceeding again—for he
was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own
accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,
by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to
go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its
curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom’s leg and
began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad—for that meant that
he was going to have a new suit of clothes—without the shadow of a
doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared,
from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled
manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,
and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed
the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and
said, “Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your
children’s alone,” and she took wing and went off to see about it—which
did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was
credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity
more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and
Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body
and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A
catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom’s head, and trilled
out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then
a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig
almost within the boy’s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the
strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow
of the “fox” kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to
inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never
seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.
All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight
pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few
butterflies came fluttering upon the scene."
632,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with
a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and
tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white
sandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the
distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a
slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only
gratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge
between them and civilization."
633,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and
ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a
spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak
or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood
charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While Joe
was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a
minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in
their lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time
to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass,
a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish—provisions enough for quite a
family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for
no fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the
quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better
he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping,
open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too."
634,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,
and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They
tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush,
among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the
ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came
upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers."
635,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be
astonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles
long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to
was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards
wide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle
of the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too hungry to
stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw
themselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag,
and then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods,
and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys.
They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This
took dim shape, presently—it was budding homesickness. Even Finn the
Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they
were all ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak
his thought."
636,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar
sound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a
clock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound
became more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started,
glanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude. There
was a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came
floating down out of the distance."
637,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"“What is it!” exclaimed Joe, under his breath."
638,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"“I wonder,” said Tom in a whisper."
639,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"“’Tain’t thunder,” said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, “becuz thunder—”"
640,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,“Hark!” said Tom. “Listen—don’t talk.”
641,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom
troubled the solemn hush."
642,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,“Let’s go and see.”
643,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They
parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little
steam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the
current. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great
many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood
of the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in
them were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the
ferryboat’s side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same
dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again."
644,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,“I know now!” exclaimed Tom; “somebody’s drownded!”
645,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"“That’s it!” said Huck; “they done that last summer, when Bill Turner
got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes
him come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put
quicksilver in ’em and set ’em afloat, and wherever there’s anybody
that’s drownded, they’ll float right there and stop.”"
646,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"“Yes, I’ve heard about that,” said Joe. “I wonder what makes the bread
do that.”"
647,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"“Oh, it ain’t the bread, so much,” said Tom; “I reckon it’s mostly what
they _say_ over it before they start it out.”"
648,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"“But they don’t say anything over it,” said Huck. “I’ve seen ’em and
they don’t.”"
649,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"“Well, that’s funny,” said Tom. “But maybe they say it to themselves. Of
_course_ they do. Anybody might know that.”"
650,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because
an ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not
be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such
gravity."
651,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"“By jings, I wish I was over there, now,” said Joe."
652,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"“I do too,” said Huck. “I’d give heaps to know who it is.”"
653,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought
flashed through Tom’s mind, and he exclaimed:"
654,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"“Boys, I know who’s drownded—it’s us!”"
655,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they
were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account;
tears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor
lost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being
indulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town,
and the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was
concerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all."
656,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business
and the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were
jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble
they were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then
fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them;
and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were
gratifying to look upon—from their point of view. But when the shadows
of night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing
into the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The
excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts
of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as
much as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a
sigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a
roundabout “feeler” as to how the others might look upon a return to
civilization—not right now, but—"
657,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"Tom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined
in with Tom, and the waverer quickly “explained,” and was glad to get
out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness
clinging to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to
rest for the moment."
658,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter14.txt,"As the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore.
Joe followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time,
watching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees,
and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung
by the campfire. He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders
of the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed
to suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something
upon each of these with his “red keel”; one he rolled up and put in his
jacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe’s hat and removed it to a
little distance from the owner. And he also put into the hat certain
schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value—among them a lump of
chalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind
of marbles known as a “sure ’nough crystal.” Then he tiptoed his way
cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and
straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar"
659,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,CHAPTER XV
660,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"A few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward
the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway
over; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out
confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering
upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had
expected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till
he found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket
pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods,
following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten
o’clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the
ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything
was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching
with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes
and climbed into the skiff that did “yawl” duty at the boat’s stern. He
laid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting."
661,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to “cast
off.” A minute or two later the skiff’s head was standing high up,
against the boat’s swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in
his success, for he knew it was the boat’s last trip for the night. At
the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and
Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards
downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers."
662,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his
aunt’s back fence. He climbed over, approached the “ell,” and looked
in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There
sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper’s mother, grouped together,
talking. They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the
door. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then
he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing
cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might
squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,
warily."
663,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"“What makes the candle blow so?” said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. “Why,
that door’s open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange
things now. Go ’long and shut it, Sid.”"
664,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and “breathed”
 himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his
aunt’s foot."
665,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"“But as I was saying,” said Aunt Polly, “he warn’t _bad_, so to say—only
misch_ee_vous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn’t
any more responsible than a colt. _He_ never meant any harm, and he was
the best-hearted boy that ever was”—and she began to cry."
666,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"“It was just so with my Joe—always full of his devilment, and up to
every kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he
could be—and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking
that cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because
it was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never, never,
never, poor abused boy!” And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would
break."
667,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"“I hope Tom’s better off where he is,” said Sid, “but if he’d been
better in some ways—”"
668,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"“_Sid!_” Tom felt the glare of the old lady’s eye, though he could not
see it. “Not a word against my Tom, now that he’s gone! God’ll take care
of _him_—never you trouble _your_self, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don’t
know how to give him up! I don’t know how to give him up! He was such a
comfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, ’most.”"
669,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"“The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away—Blessed be the name of
the Lord! But it’s so hard—Oh, it’s so hard! Only last Saturday my Joe
busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling.
Little did I know then, how soon—Oh, if it was to do over again I’d hug
him and bless him for it.”"
670,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"“Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just
exactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took
and filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would
tear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom’s head with my
thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he’s out of all his troubles now.
And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach—”"
671,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely
down. Tom was snuffling, now, himself—and more in pity of himself than
anybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word
for him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself
than ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt’s grief
to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy—and
the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his
nature, too, but he resisted and lay still."
672,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was
conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim;
then the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing
lads had promised that the village should “hear something” soon; the
wise-heads had “put this and that together” and decided that the lads
had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below,
presently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the
Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village—and then hope
perished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home
by nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the
bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must
have occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would
otherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the bodies
continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the
funerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered."
673,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. Then with a
mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other’s
arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was
tender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to Sid and Mary. Sid
snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart."
674,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly,
and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,
that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through."
675,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making
broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and
turning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her
sleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the
candle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full
of pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the
candle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.
His face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark
hastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and
straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him."
676,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large
there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was
tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and
slept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped
into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a
mile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself
stoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for
this was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture
the skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore
legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be
made for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and
entered the woods."
677,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep
awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far
spent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the
island bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the
great river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream. A
little later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and
heard Joe say:"
678,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"“No, Tom’s true-blue, Huck, and he’ll come back. He won’t desert. He
knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom’s too proud for that
sort of thing. He’s up to something or other. Now I wonder what?”"
679,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"“Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain’t they?”"
680,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"“Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain’t
back here to breakfast.”"
681,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"“Which he is!” exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping
grandly into camp."
682,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter15.txt,"A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the
boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.
They were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done.
Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the
other pirates got ready to fish and explore."

684,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"Saturday morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and
fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if
the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in
every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom
and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond
the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far
enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting."
685,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a
long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and
a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board
fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a
burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost
plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant
whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed
fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at
the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from
the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom’s eyes, before, but
now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at
the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there
waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,
skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred
and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an
hour—and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:"
686,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"“Say, Jim, I’ll fetch the water if you’ll whitewash some.”"
687,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,Jim shook his head and said:

689,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"“Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That’s the way she always talks.
Gimme the bucket—I won’t be gone only a a minute. _She_ won’t ever

thimble—and who cares for that, I’d like to know. She talks awful, but

marvel. I’ll give you a white alley!”"

696,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"Jim was only human—this attraction was too much for him. He put down
his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing
interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he
was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was
whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with
a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye."
697,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"But Tom’s energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had
planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys
would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and
they would make a world of fun of him for having to work—the very
thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and
examined it—bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange
of _work_, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour
of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and
gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless
moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great,
magnificent inspiration."
698,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in
sight presently—the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been
dreading. Ben’s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump—proof enough that his
heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and
giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned
ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As
he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned
far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp
and circumstance—for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered
himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and
engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own
hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:"

drew up slowly toward the sidewalk."

he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as
before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom’s mouth watered for the

717,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"“Like it? Well, I don’t see why I oughtn’t to like it. Does a boy get a
chance to whitewash a fence every day?”"
718,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple.
Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth—stepped back to note the
effect—added a touch here and there—criticised the effect again—Ben
watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more
absorbed. Presently he said:"
719,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"“Say, Tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.”"
720,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:"
721,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"“No—no—I reckon it wouldn’t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly’s awful
particular about this fence—right here on the street, you know—but if it
was the back fence I wouldn’t mind and _she_ wouldn’t. Yes, she’s awful
particular about this fence; it’s got to be done very careful; I reckon
there ain’t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it
the way it’s got to be done.”"
722,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"“No—is that so? Oh come, now—lemme just try. Only just a little—I’d let
_you_, if you was me, Tom.”"
723,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"“Ben, I’d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly—well, Jim wanted to do
it, but she wouldn’t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn’t let
Sid. Now don’t you see how I’m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence
and anything was to happen to it—”"
724,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"“Oh, shucks, I’ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say—I’ll give you
the core of my apple.”"
725,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"“Well, here—No, Ben, now don’t. I’m afeard—”"
726,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,“I’ll give you _all_ of it!”
727,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his
heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the
sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,
dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more
innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every
little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time
Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for
a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in
for a dead rat and a string to swing it with—and so on, and so on, hour
after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a
poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in
wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part
of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool
cannon, a key that wouldn’t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a
glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,
six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a
dog-collar—but no dog—the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel,
and a dilapidated old window sash."
728,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while—plenty of company—and
the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn’t run out of
whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village."
729,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He
had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it—namely,
that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary
to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and
wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have
comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is _obliged_ to do,
and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And
this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or
performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing
Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England
who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a
daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable
money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn
it into work and then they would resign."
730,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter2.txt,"The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place
in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to
report."
731,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,CHAPTER III
732,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"Tom presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an
open window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,
breakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer
air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing
murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her
knitting—for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her
lap. Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had
thought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at
seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He
said: “Mayn’t I go and play now, aunt?”"
733,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"“What, a’ready? How much have you done?”"
734,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"“It’s all done, aunt.”"
735,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"“Tom, don’t lie to me—I can’t bear it.”"
736,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"“I ain’t, aunt; it _is_ all done.”"
737,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for
herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of
Tom’s statement true. When she found the entire fence white-washed, and
not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a
streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She
said:"
738,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"“Well, I never! There’s no getting round it, you can work when you’re a
mind to, Tom.” And then she diluted the compliment by adding, “But it’s
powerful seldom you’re a mind to, I’m bound to say. Well, go ’long and
play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I’ll tan you.”"
739,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took
him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,
along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat
took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.
And while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he “hooked” a
doughnut."
740,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway
that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and
the air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a
hail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties
and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect,
and Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general
thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at
peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his
black thread and getting him into trouble."
741,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the
back of his aunt’s cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach
of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the
village, where two “military” companies of boys had met for conflict,
according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these
armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two
great commanders did not condescend to fight in person—that being better
suited to the still smaller fry—but sat together on an eminence
and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through
aides-de-camp. Tom’s army won a great victory, after a long and
hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged,
the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the
necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and
marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone."
742,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new
girl in the garden—a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow
hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered
pantalettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A
certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a
memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction;
he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor
little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had
confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest
boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time
she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is
done."
743,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had
discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and
began to “show off” in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win
her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time;
but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic
performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending
her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it,
grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a
moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great
sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up,
right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she
disappeared."
744,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and
then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as
if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.
Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his
nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side,
in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his
bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped
away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a
minute—only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next
his heart—or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in
anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway."
745,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, “showing
off,” as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom
comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some
window, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode
home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions."
746,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered “what
had got into the child.” He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and
did not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his
aunt’s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:"
747,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"“Aunt, you don’t whack Sid when he takes it.”"
748,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"“Well, Sid don’t torment a body the way you do. You’d be always into
that sugar if I warn’t watching you.”"
749,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity,
reached for the sugar-bowl—a sort of glorying over Tom which was
wellnigh unbearable. But Sid’s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and
broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled
his tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a
word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she
asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be
nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model “catch it.” He was
so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old
lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath
from over her spectacles. He said to himself, “Now it’s coming!” And the
next instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted
to strike again when Tom cried out:"
750,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"“Hold on, now, what ’er you belting _me_ for?—Sid broke it!”"
751,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when
she got her tongue again, she only said:"
752,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"“Umf! Well, you didn’t get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some
other audacious mischief when I wasn’t around, like enough.”"
753,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something
kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a
confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.
So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.
Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart
his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the
consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice
of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then,
through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured
himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching
one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and
die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured
himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and
his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how
her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back
her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would
lie there cold and white and make no sign—a poor little sufferer, whose
griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of
these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke;
and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked,
and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to
him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any
worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too
sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced
in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit
of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness
out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other."
754,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate
places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the river
invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated
the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could
only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the
uncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought of his flower.
He got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal
felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would she
cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and
comfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world?
This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he
worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and
varied lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing
and departed in the darkness."
755,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"About half-past nine or ten o’clock he came along the deserted street to
where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon
his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain
of a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the
fence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under
that window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him
down on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his
hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower.
And thus he would die—out in the cold world, with no shelter over his
homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow,
no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And
thus _she_ would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and
oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would
she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted,
so untimely cut down?"
756,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"The window went up, a maid-servant’s discordant voice profaned the holy
calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr’s remains!"
757,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz
as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound
as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the
fence and shot away in the gloom."
758,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his
drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he
had any dim idea of making any “references to allusions,” he thought
better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom’s eye."
759,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter3.txt,"Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made mental
note of the omission."
760,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,CHAPTER IV
761,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"The sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful
village like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family
worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid
courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of
originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of
the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai."
762,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to “get
his verses.” Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his
energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the
Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.
At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,
but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human
thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took
his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the
fog:"
763,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,“Blessed are the—a—a—”
764,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,“Poor”—

769,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“For _theirs_. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they—they—”"

772,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“S, H, A—”"
773,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“For they S, H—Oh, I don’t know what it is!”"
774,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,“_Shall_!”
775,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“Oh, _shall_! for they shall—for they shall—a—a—shall
mourn—a—a—blessed are they that shall—they that—a—they that
shall mourn, for they shall—a—shall _what_? Why don’t you tell me,
Mary?—what do you want to be so mean for?”"
776,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I’m not teasing you. I wouldn’t
do that. You must go and learn it again. Don’t you be discouraged, Tom,
you’ll manage it—and if you do, I’ll give you something ever so nice.
There, now, that’s a good boy.”"
777,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.”"
778,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it’s nice, it is nice.”"
779,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“You bet you that’s so, Mary. All right, I’ll tackle it again.”"
780,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"And he did “tackle it again”—and under the double pressure of curiosity
and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a
shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new “Barlow” knife worth twelve
and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system
shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything,
but it was a “sure-enough” Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur
in that—though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a
weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing
mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the
cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was
called off to dress for Sunday-school."
781,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went
outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he
dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;
poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen
and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But
Mary removed the towel and said:"
782,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“Now ain’t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn’t be so bad. Water won’t hurt
you.”"
783,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he
stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath
and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut
and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of
suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from
the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped
short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line
there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in
front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she
was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of
color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls
wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately
smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his
hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his
own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his
clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years—they were
simply called his “other clothes”—and so by that we know the size of his
wardrobe. The girl “put him to rights” after he had dressed himself;
she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt
collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with
his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and
uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there
was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He
hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she
coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought
them out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do
everything he didn’t want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:"
784,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“Please, Tom—that’s a good boy.”"
785,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three
children set out for Sunday-school—a place that Tom hated with his whole
heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it."
786,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church
service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,
and the other always remained too—for stronger reasons. The church’s
high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons;
the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board
tree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step
and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:"
787,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?”"
788,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,“Yes.”
789,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,“What’ll you take for her?”
790,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,“What’ll you give?”
791,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,“Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.”
792,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,“Less see ’em.”
793,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.
Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some
small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other
boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten
or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm
of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started
a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave,
elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a
boy’s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy
turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear
him say “Ouch!” and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom’s whole
class were of a pattern—restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came
to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but
had to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each
got his reward—in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture
on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten
blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red
tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent
gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy
times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and
application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Doré Bible? And
yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way—it was the patient work of
two years—and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once
recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his
mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot
from that day forth—a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great
occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it)
had always made this boy come out and “spread himself.” Only the older
pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work
long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes
was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so
great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar’s
heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple
of weeks. It is possible that Tom’s mental stomach had never really
hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being
had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it."
794,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with
a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its
leaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent
makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as
necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer
who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert—though
why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music
is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim
creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he
wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears
and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth—a
fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the
whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a
spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had
fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion
of the day, like sleigh-runners—an effect patiently and laboriously
produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a
wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very
sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places
in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that
unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar
intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this
fashion:"
795,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as
you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There—that
is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one
little girl who is looking out of the window—I am afraid she thinks I
am out there somewhere—perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech
to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it
makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a
place like this, learning to do right and be good.” And so forth and so
on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a
pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all."
796,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights
and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings
and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of
isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound
ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters’ voice, and the
conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude."
797,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was
more or less rare—the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied
by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman
with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter’s
wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of
chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too—he could not meet Amy
Lawrence’s eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this
small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next
moment he was “showing off” with all his might—cuffing boys, pulling
hair, making faces—in a word, using every art that seemed likely to
fascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one
alloy—the memory of his humiliation in this angel’s garden—and that
record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that
were sweeping over it now."
798,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.
Walters’ speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The
middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage—no less a one
than the county judge—altogether the most august creation these children
had ever looked upon—and they wondered what kind of material he was made
of—and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might,
too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away—so he had travelled,
and seen the world—these very eyes had looked upon the county
court-house—which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these
reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the
ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of
their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar
with the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music
to his soul to hear the whisperings:"
799,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“Look at him, Jim! He’s a going up there. Say—look! he’s a going to
shake hands with him—he _is_ shaking hands with him! By jings, don’t you
wish you was Jeff?”"
800,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"Mr. Walters fell to “showing off,” with all sorts of official bustlings
and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging
directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The
librarian “showed off”—running hither and thither with his arms full of
books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority
delights in. The young lady teachers “showed off”—bending sweetly over
pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers
at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen
teachers “showed off” with small scoldings and other little displays of
authority and fine attention to discipline—and most of the teachers, of
both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was
business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times
(with much seeming vexation). The little girls “showed off” in various
ways, and the little boys “showed off” with such diligence that the air
was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it
all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all
the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur—for he was
“showing off,” too."
801,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters’ ecstasy complete,
and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.
Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough—he had been
around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now,
to have that German lad back again with a sound mind."
802,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with
nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded
a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not
expecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But
there was no getting around it—here were the certified checks, and they
were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with
the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from
headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and
so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the
judicial one’s altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon
in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy—but those that
suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they
themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to
Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.
These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a
guileful snake in the grass."
803,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the
superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked
somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow’s instinct taught him
that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,
perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two
thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises—a dozen would
strain his capacity, without a doubt."
804,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in
her face—but he wouldn’t look. She wondered; then she was just a grain
troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went—came again; she watched;
a furtive glance told her worlds—and then her heart broke, and she was
jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most
of all (she thought)."
805,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath
would hardly come, his heart quaked—partly because of the awful
greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would
have liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The
Judge put his hand on Tom’s head and called him a fine little man, and
asked him what his name was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:"
806,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,“Tom.”
807,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“Oh, no, not Tom—it is—”"

809,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“Ah, that’s it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That’s very well.
But you’ve another one I daresay, and you’ll tell it to me, won’t you?”"
810,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,” said Walters, “and say
sir. You mustn’t forget your manners.”"
811,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,“Thomas Sawyer—sir.”
812,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"“That’s it! That’s a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two
thousand verses is a great many—very, very great many. And you never can
be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth
more than anything there is in the world; it’s what makes great men
and good men; you’ll be a great man and a good man yourself, some
day, Thomas, and then you’ll look back and say, It’s all owing to the
precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood—it’s all owing to
my dear teachers that taught me to learn—it’s all owing to the good
superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a
beautiful Bible—a splendid elegant Bible—to keep and have it all for my
own, always—it’s all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will
say, Thomas—and you wouldn’t take any money for those two thousand
verses—no indeed you wouldn’t. And now you wouldn’t mind telling me and
this lady some of the things you’ve learned—no, I know you wouldn’t—for
we are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no doubt you know the names
of all the twelve disciples. Won’t you tell us the names of the first
two that were appointed?”"
813,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter4.txt,"Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed,
now, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters’ heart sank within him. He said
to himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest
question—why _did_ the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up
and say:"

820,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter5.txt,"About half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,
and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The
Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and
occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt
Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her—Tom being placed next
the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window
and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up
the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days;
the mayor and his wife—for they had a mayor there, among other
unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglas, fair,
smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill
mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much
the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could
boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the
new notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by
a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all
the young clerks in town in a body—for they had stood in the vestibule
sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering
admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came
the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as
if she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was
the pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so
good. And besides, he had been “thrown up to them” so much. His
white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on
Sundays—accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys
who had as snobs."
821,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter5.txt,"The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,
to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the
church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the
choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all
through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,
but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago,
and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in
some foreign country."
822,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter5.txt,"The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a
peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His
voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a
certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word
and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:"
823,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter5.txt,"Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow’ry _beds_
 of ease,"
824,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter5.txt,"Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro’ _blood_
 -y seas?"
825,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter5.txt,"He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church “sociables” he was
always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies
would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,
and “wall” their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, “Words
cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal
earth.”"
826,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter5.txt,"After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into
a bulletin-board, and read off “notices” of meetings and societies and
things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of
doom—a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities,
away here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is
to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it."
827,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter5.txt,"And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went
into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the
church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;
for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United
States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the
President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed
by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of
European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light
and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear
withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with
a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace
and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a
grateful harvest of good. Amen."
828,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter5.txt,"There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.
The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he
only endured it—if he even did that much. He was restive all through it;
he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously—for he was not
listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman’s regular
route over it—and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,
his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered
additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had
lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by
calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and
polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with
the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping
its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they
had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if
it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom’s
hands itched to grab for it they did not dare—he believed his soul would
be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going
on. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal
forward; and the instant the “Amen” was out the fly was a prisoner of
war. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go."
829,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter5.txt,"The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an
argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod—and
yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and
thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly
worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he
always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything
else about the discourse. However, this time he was really interested
for a little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the
assembling together of the world’s hosts at the millennium when the lion
and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead
them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle
were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the
principal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the
thought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child,
if it was a tame lion."
830,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter5.txt,"Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.
Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was
a large black beetle with formidable jaws—a “pinchbug,” he called it. It
was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to
take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went
floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went
into the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,
unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out
of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in
the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came
idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the
quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the
drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around
it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew
bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly
snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy
the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,
and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent
and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin
descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp,
a flirt of the poodle’s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards
away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators
shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and
hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,
and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a
craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on
it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his
fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at
it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But
he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a
fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close
to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the
beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony
and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so
did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew
down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the
home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was
but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of
light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang
into its master’s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of
distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance."
831,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter5.txt,"By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with
suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.
The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all
possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest
sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of
unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson
had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole
congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced."
832,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter5.txt,"Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was
some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety
in it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog
should play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in
him to carry it off."

834,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"Monday morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found
him so—because it began another week’s slow suffering in school. He
generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday,
it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious."
835,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was
sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility.
He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated
again. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he
began to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew
feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly
he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This
was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a “starter,” as he
called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that
argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought
he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.
Nothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing
the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or
three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly
drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.
But now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed
well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable
spirit."

837,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe."

841,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"Tom was aggravated. He said, “Sid, Sid!” and shook him. This course
worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then
brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.
Tom went on groaning. Sid said:"
842,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Tom! Say, Tom!” [No response.] “Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter,

855,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom’s dying!”"
856,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Dying!”
857,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Yes’m. Don’t wait—come quick!”
858,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Rubbage! I don’t believe it!”
859,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"But she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels.
And her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the
bedside she gasped out:"
860,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“You, Tom! Tom, what’s the matter with you?”"
861,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Oh, auntie, I’m—”"
862,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“What’s the matter with you—what is the matter with you, child?”"
863,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Oh, auntie, my sore toe’s mortified!”"
864,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a
little, then did both together. This restored her and she said:"
865,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and
climb out of this.”"
866,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a
little foolish, and he said:"
867,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Aunt Polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my
tooth at all.”"
868,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Your tooth, indeed! What’s the matter with your tooth?”"
869,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“One of them’s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.”"
870,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“There, there, now, don’t begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.
Well—your tooth _is_ loose, but you’re not going to die about that.
Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.”"
871,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,Tom said:
872,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Oh, please, auntie, don’t pull it out. It don’t hurt any more. I wish
I may never stir if it does. Please don’t, auntie. I don’t want to stay
home from school.”"
873,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Oh, you don’t, don’t you? So all this row was because you thought you’d
get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so,
and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your
outrageousness.” By this time the dental instruments were ready. The old
lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom’s tooth with a loop
and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and
suddenly thrust it almost into the boy’s face. The tooth hung dangling
by the bedpost, now."
874,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after
breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his
upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable
way. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition;
and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and
homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,
and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain
which he did not feel that it wasn’t anything to spit like Tom Sawyer;
but another boy said, “Sour grapes!” and he wandered away a dismantled
hero."
875,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry
Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and
dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless
and vulgar and bad—and because all their children admired him so, and
delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like
him. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied
Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders
not to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.
Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown
men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat
was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat,
when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons
far down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of
the trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged
in the dirt when not rolled up."
876,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps
in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to
school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could
go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it
suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he
pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring
and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor
put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything
that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed,
hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg."
877,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,Tom hailed the romantic outcast:
878,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Hello, Huckleberry!”"
879,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Hello yourself, and see how you like it.”"
880,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“What’s that you got?”
881,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Dead cat.”
882,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Lemme see him, Huck. My, he’s pretty stiff. Where’d you get him?”"
883,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Bought him off’n a boy.”
884,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“What did you give?”
885,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.”
886,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Where’d you get the blue ticket?”
887,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Bought it off’n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.”
888,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Say—what is dead cats good for, Huck?”"
889,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Good for? Cure warts with.”
890,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“No! Is that so? I know something that’s better.”
891,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“I bet you don’t. What is it?”
892,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Why, spunk-water.”"
893,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Spunk-water! I wouldn’t give a dern for spunk-water.”
894,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“You wouldn’t, wouldn’t you? D’you ever try it?”"
895,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“No, I hain’t. But Bob Tanner did.”"
896,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Who told you so!”
897,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny
told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the
nigger told me. There now!”"
898,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Well, what of it? They’ll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I
don’t know _him_. But I never see a nigger that _wouldn’t_ lie. Shucks!
Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.”"
899,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water
was.”"
900,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“In the daytime?”
901,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Certainly.”
902,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“With his face to the stump?”
903,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Yes. Least I reckon so.”
904,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Did he say anything?”
905,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“I don’t reckon he did. I don’t know.”
906,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool
way as that! Why, that ain’t a-going to do any good. You got to go all
by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there’s a
spunk-water stump, and just as it’s midnight you back up against the
stump and jam your hand in and say:"
907,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"‘Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,
 Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,’"
908,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then
turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.
Because if you speak the charm’s busted.”"
909,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain’t the way Bob Tanner
done.”"
910,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“No, sir, you can bet he didn’t, becuz he’s the wartiest boy in this
town; and he wouldn’t have a wart on him if he’d knowed how to work
spunk-water. I’ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,
Huck. I play with frogs so much that I’ve always got considerable many
warts. Sometimes I take ’em off with a bean.”"
911,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Yes, bean’s good. I’ve done that.”"
912,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Have you? What’s your way?”
913,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood,
and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig
a hole and bury it ’bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the
moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece
that’s got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to
fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the
wart, and pretty soon off she comes.”"
914,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Yes, that’s it, Huck—that’s it; though when you’re burying it if you
say ‘Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!’ it’s better.
That’s the way Joe Harper does, and he’s been nearly to Coonville and
most everywheres. But say—how do you cure ’em with dead cats?”"
915,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard ’long about
midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it’s
midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can’t see
’em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear ’em talk;
and when they’re taking that feller away, you heave your cat after ’em
and say, ‘Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I’m
done with ye!’ That’ll fetch _any_ wart.”"
916,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Sounds right. D’you ever try it, Huck?”"
917,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.”"
918,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Well, I reckon it’s so, then. Becuz they say she’s a witch.”"
919,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Say! Why, Tom, I _know_ she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own
self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he
took up a rock, and if she hadn’t dodged, he’d a got her. Well, that
very night he rolled off’n a shed wher’ he was a layin drunk, and broke
his arm.”"
920,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Why, that’s awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?”"
921,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right
stiddy, they’re a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when
they mumble they’re saying the Lord’s Prayer backards.”"
922,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?”"
923,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“To-night. I reckon they’ll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.”
924,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“But they buried him Saturday. Didn’t they get him Saturday night?”
925,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?—and
_then_ it’s Sunday. Devils don’t slosh around much of a Sunday, I don’t
reckon.”"
926,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“I never thought of that. That’s so. Lemme go with you?”
927,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Of course—if you ain’t afeard.”
928,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Afeard! ’Tain’t likely. Will you meow?”
929,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Yes—and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep’ me
a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says
‘Dern that cat!’ and so I hove a brick through his window—but don’t you
tell.”"
930,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“I won’t. I couldn’t meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but
I’ll meow this time. Say—what’s that?”"
931,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Nothing but a tick.”
932,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Where’d you get him?”
933,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Out in the woods.”
934,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“What’ll you take for him?”
935,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“I don’t know. I don’t want to sell him.”
936,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“All right. It’s a mighty small tick, anyway.”"
937,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don’t belong to them. I’m
satisfied with it. It’s a good enough tick for me.”"
938,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Sho, there’s ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of ’em if I wanted
to.”"
939,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Well, why don’t you? Becuz you know mighty well you can’t. This is a
pretty early tick, I reckon. It’s the first one I’ve seen this year.”"
940,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Say, Huck—I’ll give you my tooth for him.”"
941,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Less see it.”
942,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed
it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:"
943,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Is it genuwyne?”
944,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.
945,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Well, all right,” said Huckleberry, “it’s a trade.”"
946,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the
pinchbug’s prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than
before."
947,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"When Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in
briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He
hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like
alacrity. The master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom
arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The
interruption roused him."
948,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Thomas Sawyer!”
949,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble."
950,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Sir!”
951,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?”"
952,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of
yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric
sympathy of love; and by that form was _the only vacant place_ on the
girls’ side of the school-house. He instantly said:"
953,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“_I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn!_”
954,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"The master’s pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of
study ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his
mind. The master said:"
955,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“You—you did what?”
956,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.”
957,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,There was no mistaking the words.
958,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever
listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your
jacket.”"
959,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"The master’s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches
notably diminished. Then the order followed:"
960,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.”"
961,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but
in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe
of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good
fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched
herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and
whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the
long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book."
962,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur
rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal
furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, “made a mouth” at him
and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she
cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it
away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less
animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it
remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, “Please take it—I got more.” The
girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw
something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time
the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began
to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,
apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt
to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she
gave in and hesitatingly whispered:"
963,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Let me see it.”
964,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends
to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl’s
interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything
else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:"
965,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“It’s nice—make a man.”
966,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He
could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;
she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:"
967,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“It’s a beautiful man—now make me coming along.”
968,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed
the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:"
969,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“It’s ever so nice—I wish I could draw.”
970,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“It’s easy,” whispered Tom, “I’ll learn you.”"
971,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Oh, will you? When?”"
972,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“At noon. Do you go home to dinner?”
973,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“I’ll stay if you will.”
974,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Good—that’s a whack. What’s your name?”
975,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Becky Thatcher. What’s yours? Oh, I know. It’s Thomas Sawyer.”"
976,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“That’s the name they lick me by. I’m Tom when I’m good. You call me
Tom, will you?”"
977,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Yes.”
978,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from
the girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom
said:"
979,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Oh, it ain’t anything.”"
980,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“Yes it is.”
981,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“No it ain’t. You don’t want to see.”
982,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.”"
983,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“You’ll tell.”
984,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,“No I won’t—deed and deed and double deed won’t.”
985,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“You won’t tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?”"
986,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“No, I won’t ever tell _any_body. Now let me.”"
987,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Oh, _you_ don’t want to see!”"
988,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Now that you treat me so, I _will_ see.” And she put her small hand
upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in
earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were
revealed: “_I love you_.”"
989,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"“Oh, you bad thing!” And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and
looked pleased, nevertheless."
990,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his
ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the
house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles
from the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful
moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But
although Tom’s ear tingled, his heart was jubilant."
991,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter6.txt,"As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but
the turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the
reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and
turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into
continents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and
got “turned down,” by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought
up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with
ostentation for months."

993,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"The harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas
wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed
to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead.
There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days.
The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed
the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the
flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a
shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds
floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible
but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom’s heart ached to be free, or
else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.
His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of
gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively
the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on
the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that
amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when
he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and
made him take a new direction."
994,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"Tom’s bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and
now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in
an instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn
friends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a
pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.
The sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were
interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit
of the tick. So he put Joe’s slate on the desk and drew a line down the
middle of it from top to bottom."
995,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Now,” said he, “as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and
I’ll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,
you’re to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.”"
996,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“All right, go ahead; start him up.”"
997,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe
harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This
change of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with
absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the
two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all
things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The
tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as
anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would
have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom’s fingers would
be twitching to begin, Joe’s pin would deftly head him off, and keep
possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too
strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in
a moment. Said he:"
998,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Tom, you let him alone.”"
999,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.”"
1000,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“No, sir, it ain’t fair; you just let him alone.”"
1001,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Blame it, I ain’t going to stir him much.”"
1002,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Let him alone, I tell you.”"
1003,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“I won’t!”
1004,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“You shall—he’s on my side of the line.”
1005,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?”"
1006,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“I don’t care whose tick he is—he’s on my side of the line, and you
sha’n’t touch him.”"
1007,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Well, I’ll just bet I will, though. He’s my tick and I’ll do what I
blame please with him, or die!”"
1008,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"A tremendous whack came down on Tom’s shoulders, and its duplicate on
Joe’s; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from
the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been
too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile
before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them.
He had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed
his bit of variety to it."
1009,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered
in her ear:"
1010,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Put on your bonnet and let on you’re going home; and when you get to
the corner, give the rest of ’em the slip, and turn down through the
lane and come back. I’ll go the other way and come it over ’em the same
way.”"
1011,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with
another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and
when they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they
sat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil
and held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising
house. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking.
Tom was swimming in bliss. He said:"
1012,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“Do you love rats?”
1013,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“No! I hate them!”
1014,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Well, I do, too—_live_ ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your
head with a string.”"
1015,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“No, I don’t care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.”"
1016,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.”"
1017,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Do you? I’ve got some. I’ll let you chew it awhile, but you must give
it back to me.”"
1018,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs
against the bench in excess of contentment."
1019,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“Was you ever at a circus?” said Tom.
1020,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Yes, and my pa’s going to take me again some time, if I’m good.”"
1021,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“I been to the circus three or four times—lots of times. Church ain’t
shucks to a circus. There’s things going on at a circus all the time.
I’m going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.”"
1022,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Oh, are you! That will be nice. They’re so lovely, all spotted up.”"
1023,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Yes, that’s so. And they get slathers of money—most a dollar a day, Ben
Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?”"
1024,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“What’s that?”
1025,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Why, engaged to be married.”"
1026,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“No.”
1027,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“Would you like to?”
1028,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“I reckon so. I don’t know. What is it like?”
1029,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Like? Why it ain’t like anything. You only just tell a boy you won’t
ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that’s
all. Anybody can do it.”"
1030,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“Kiss? What do you kiss for?”
1031,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Why, that, you know, is to—well, they always do that.”"
1032,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“Everybody?”
1033,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Why, yes, everybody that’s in love with each other. Do you remember
what I wrote on the slate?”"
1034,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“Ye—yes.”
1035,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“What was it?”
1036,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“I sha’n’t tell you.”
1037,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“Shall I tell _you_?”
1038,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“Ye—yes—but some other time.”
1039,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“No, now.”"
1040,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“No, not now—to-morrow.”"
1041,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Oh, no, _now_. Please, Becky—I’ll whisper it, I’ll whisper it ever so
easy.”"
1042,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about
her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to
her ear. And then he added:"
1043,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“Now you whisper it to me—just the same.”
1044,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"She resisted, for a while, and then said:"
1045,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“You turn your face away so you can’t see, and then I will. But you
mustn’t ever tell anybody—_will_ you, Tom? Now you won’t, _will_ you?”"
1046,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“No, indeed, indeed I won’t. Now, Becky.”"
1047,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred
his curls and whispered, “I—love—you!”"
1048,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,
with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little
white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:"
1049,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Now, Becky, it’s all done—all over but the kiss. Don’t you be afraid
of that—it ain’t anything at all. Please, Becky.” And he tugged at her
apron and the hands."
1050,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing
with the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and
said:"
1051,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Now it’s all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain’t
ever to love anybody but me, and you ain’t ever to marry anybody but me,
ever never and forever. Will you?”"
1052,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“No, I’ll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I’ll never marry anybody
but you—and you ain’t to ever marry anybody but me, either.”"
1053,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Certainly. Of course. That’s _part_ of it. And always coming to school
or when we’re going home, you’re to walk with me, when there ain’t
anybody looking—and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because
that’s the way you do when you’re engaged.”"
1054,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,“It’s so nice. I never heard of it before.”
1055,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Oh, it’s ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence—”"
1056,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused."
1057,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Oh, Tom! Then I ain’t the first you’ve ever been engaged to!”"
1058,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,The child began to cry. Tom said:
1059,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Oh, don’t cry, Becky, I don’t care for her any more.”"
1060,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Yes, you do, Tom—you know you do.”"
1061,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and
turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with
soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was
up, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and
uneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping
she would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began
to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle
with him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and
entered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with
her face to the wall. Tom’s heart smote him. He went to her and stood a
moment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:"
1062,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Becky, I—I don’t care for anybody but you.”"
1063,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,No reply—but sobs.
1064,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Becky”—pleadingly. “Becky, won’t you say something?”"
1065,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,More sobs.
1066,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron,
and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:"
1067,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Please, Becky, won’t you take it?”"
1068,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over
the hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently
Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she
flew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:"
1069,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"“Tom! Come back, Tom!”"
1070,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter7.txt,"She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions
but silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid
herself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she
had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross
of a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers about
her to exchange sorrows with."
1071,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,CHAPTER VIII
1072,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"Tom dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the
track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed
a small “branch” two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile
superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later
he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff
Hill, and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the
valley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to
the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.
There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even
stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken
by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and
this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the
more profound. The boy’s soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings
were in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows
on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him
that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy
Hodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie
and slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through
the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and
nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a
clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with
it all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant
the best in the world, and been treated like a dog—like a very dog. She
would be sorry some day—maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only
die _temporarily_!"
1073,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained
shape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into
the concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and
disappeared mysteriously? What if he went away—ever so far away, into
unknown countries beyond the seas—and never came back any more! How
would she feel then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only
to fill him with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights
were an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was
exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be
a soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious.
No—better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on
the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the
Far West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with
feathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy
summer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs
of all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was
something gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it!
_now_ his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable
splendor. How his name would fill the world, and make people shudder!
How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low,
black-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying
at the fore! And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear
at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in
his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson
sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass
at his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled,
with the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy
the whisperings, “It’s Tom Sawyer the Pirate!—the Black Avenger of the
Spanish Main!”"
1074,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from
home and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore
he must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together.
He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of
it with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He
put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:"
1075,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"“What hasn’t come here, come! What’s here, stay here!”"
1076,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it
up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides
were of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom’s astonishment was boundless!
He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:"
1077,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"“Well, that beats anything!”"
1078,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The
truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and
all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried
a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a
fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just
used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered
themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been
separated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed.
Tom’s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had
many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing
before. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times
before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He
puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch
had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself
on that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot
with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and
put his mouth close to this depression and called—"
1079,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"“Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,
doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!”"
1080,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a
second and then darted under again in a fright."
1081,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,“He dasn’t tell! So it _was_ a witch that done it. I just knowed it.”
1082,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he
gave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have
the marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a
patient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to his
treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing
when he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his
pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:"
1083,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"“Brother, go find your brother!”"
1084,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must
have fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last
repetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each
other."
1085,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green
aisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned
a suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,
disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and
in a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged,
with fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an
answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way
and that. He said cautiously—to an imaginary company:"
1086,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"“Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.”"
1087,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.
Tom called:"
1088,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,“Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?”
1089,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,“Guy of Guisborne wants no man’s pass. Who art thou that—that—”
1090,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"“Dares to hold such language,” said Tom, prompting—for they talked “by
the book,” from memory."
1091,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,“Who art thou that dares to hold such language?”
1092,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"“I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.”"
1093,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"“Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute
with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!”"
1094,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,
struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful
combat, “two up and two down.” Presently Tom said:"
1095,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"“Now, if you’ve got the hang, go it lively!”"
1096,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"So they “went it lively,” panting and perspiring with the work. By and
by Tom shouted:"
1097,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,“Fall! fall! Why don’t you fall?”
1098,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"“I sha’n’t! Why don’t you fall yourself? You’re getting the worst of
it.”"
1099,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"“Why, that ain’t anything. I can’t fall; that ain’t the way it is in the
book. The book says, ‘Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy
of Guisborne.’ You’re to turn around and let me hit you in the back.”"
1100,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the
whack and fell."
1101,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"“Now,” said Joe, getting up, “you got to let me kill _you_. That’s
fair.”"
1102,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"“Why, I can’t do that, it ain’t in the book.”"
1103,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"“Well, it’s blamed mean—that’s all.”"
1104,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"“Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller’s son, and lam
me with a quarter-staff; or I’ll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be
Robin Hood a little while and kill me.”"
1105,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then
Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to
bleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe,
representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,
gave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, “Where this arrow
falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.” Then he
shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle
and sprang up too gaily for a corpse."
1106,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter8.txt,"The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off
grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern
civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.
They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than
President of the United States forever."
1107,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,CHAPTER IX
1108,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"At half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.
They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and
waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be
nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He
would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was
afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark.
Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little,
scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking
of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack
mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad.
A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly’s chamber. And now the
tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate,
began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the
bed’s head made Tom shudder—it meant that somebody’s days were numbered.
Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered
by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last
he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to
doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear
it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most
melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed
him. A cry of “Scat! you devil!” and the crash of an empty bottle
against the back of his aunt’s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a
single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping
along the roof of the “ell” on all fours. He “meow’d” with caution once
or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence
to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys
moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they
were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard."
1109,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill,
about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence
around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the
time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the
whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a
tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over
the graves, leaning for support and finding none. “Sacred to the memory
of” So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have
been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light."
1110,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the
spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked
little, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the
pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the
sharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the
protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of
the grave."
1111,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of
a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom’s
reflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a
whisper:"
1112,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?”"
1113,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,Huckleberry whispered:
1114,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“I wisht I knowed. It’s awful solemn like, _ain’t_ it?”"
1115,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,“I bet it is.”
1116,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter
inwardly. Then Tom whispered:"
1117,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“Say, Hucky—do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?”"
1118,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,“O’ course he does. Least his sperrit does.”
1119,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"Tom, after a pause:"
1120,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“I wish I’d said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody
calls him Hoss.”"
1121,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“A body can’t be too partic’lar how they talk ’bout these-yer dead
people, Tom.”"
1122,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"This was a damper, and conversation died again."
1123,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,Presently Tom seized his comrade’s arm and said:
1124,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,“Sh!”
1125,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“What is it, Tom?” And the two clung together with beating hearts."
1126,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,“Sh! There ’tis again! Didn’t you hear it?”
1127,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,“I—”
1128,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,“There! Now you hear it.”
1129,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“Lord, Tom, they’re coming! They’re coming, sure. What’ll we do?”"
1130,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,“I dono. Think they’ll see us?”
1131,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn’t
come.”"
1132,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“Oh, don’t be afeard. I don’t believe they’ll bother us. We ain’t doing
any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won’t notice us at
all.”"
1133,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“I’ll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I’m all of a shiver.”"
1134,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,“Listen!”
1135,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled
sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard."
1136,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,“Look! See there!” whispered Tom. “What is it?”
1137,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“It’s devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.”"
1138,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an
old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable
little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a
shudder:"
1139,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“It’s the devils sure enough. Three of ’em! Lordy, Tom, we’re goners!
Can you pray?”"
1140,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“I’ll try, but don’t you be afeard. They ain’t going to hurt us. ‘Now I
lay me down to sleep, I—’”"
1141,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,“Sh!”
1142,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“What is it, Huck?”"
1143,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“They’re _humans_! One of ’em is, anyway. One of ’em’s old Muff Potter’s
voice.”"
1144,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“No—’tain’t so, is it?”"
1145,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“I bet I know it. Don’t you stir nor budge. He ain’t sharp enough to
notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely—blamed old rip!”"
1146,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“All right, I’ll keep still. Now they’re stuck. Can’t find it. Here they
come again. Now they’re hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They’re
p’inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o’ them voices; it’s
Injun Joe.”"
1147,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“That’s so—that murderin’ half-breed! I’d druther they was devils a dern
sight. What kin they be up to?”"
1148,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the
grave and stood within a few feet of the boys’ hiding-place."
1149,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“Here it is,” said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern
up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson."
1150,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple
of shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open the grave.
The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat
down with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so close the
boys could have touched him."
1151,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“Hurry, men!” he said, in a low voice; “the moon might come out at any
moment.”"
1152,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no
noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of
mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon
the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two
the men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with
their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The
moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.
The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a
blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a large
spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:"
1153,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“Now the cussed thing’s ready, Sawbones, and you’ll just out with
another five, or here she stays.”"
1154,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,“That’s the talk!” said Injun Joe.
1155,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“Look here, what does this mean?” said the doctor. “You required your
pay in advance, and I’ve paid you.”"
1156,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“Yes, and you done more than that,” said Injun Joe, approaching the
doctor, who was now standing. “Five years ago you drove me away from
your father’s kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to
eat, and you said I warn’t there for any good; and when I swore I’d get
even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for
a vagrant. Did you think I’d forget? The Injun blood ain’t in me for
nothing. And now I’ve _got_ you, and you got to _settle_, you know!”"
1157,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time.
The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.
Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:"
1158,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“Here, now, don’t you hit my pard!” and the next moment he had grappled
with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main,
trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe
sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter’s
knife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about
the combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung
himself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams’ grave and felled
Potter to the earth with it—and in the same instant the half-breed saw
his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man’s breast. He
reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in
the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the
two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark."
1159,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the
two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave
a long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:"
1160,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,“_That_ score is settled—damn you.”
1161,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter’s
open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three—four—five
minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed
upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a
shudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and
then around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe’s."
1162,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“Lord, how is this, Joe?” he said."
1163,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“It’s a dirty business,” said Joe, without moving. “What did you do it
for?”"
1164,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,“I! I never done it!”
1165,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,“Look here! That kind of talk won’t wash.”
1166,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,Potter trembled and grew white.
1167,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“I thought I’d got sober. I’d no business to drink to-night. But it’s
in my head yet—worse’n when we started here. I’m all in a muddle;
can’t recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe—_honest_, now,
old feller—did I do it? Joe, I never meant to—’pon my soul and honor, I
never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it’s awful—and him so
young and promising.”"
1168,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard
and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering
like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched
you another awful clip—and here you’ve laid, as dead as a wedge til
now.”"
1169,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“Oh, I didn’t know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I
did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon.
I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I’ve fought, but never
with weepons. They’ll all say that. Joe, don’t tell! Say you won’t tell,
Joe—that’s a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you,
too. Don’t you remember? You _won’t_ tell, _will_ you, Joe?” And the
poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and
clasped his appealing hands."
1170,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“No, you’ve always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I
won’t go back on you. There, now, that’s as fair as a man can say.”"
1171,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“Oh, Joe, you’re an angel. I’ll bless you for this the longest day I
live.” And Potter began to cry."
1172,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“Come, now, that’s enough of that. This ain’t any time for blubbering.
You be off yonder way and I’ll go this. Move, now, and don’t leave any
tracks behind you.”"
1173,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed
stood looking after him. He muttered:"
1174,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"“If he’s as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he
had the look of being, he won’t think of the knife till he’s gone so
far he’ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by
himself—chicken-heart!”"
1175,mark_twain,mark_twain/tom_sawyer/chapter9.txt,"Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the
lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the
moon’s. The stillness was complete again, too."
